# SEO Implementation Guide

This document explains how to implement SEO for pages in our Astro site.

## Basic Usage

The site includes a comprehensive SEO system that allows for page-specific metadata and structured data.

### Passing SEO Object to Layout

The preferred way to set SEO metadata is to create an SEO object and pass it to the Layout component:

```astro
---
import Layout from "@/layouts/Layout.astro";
---

<Layout
  seo={{
    title: "My Page Title",
    description: "A detailed description of my page for search engines",
    keywords: "keyword1, keyword2, keyword3",
    contentType: "basic",
    pathname: "/my-page"
  }}
>
  <!-- Page content -->
</Layout>
```

### Backward Compatibility

For backward compatibility, you can still use individual properties (though the object approach is preferred):

```astro
<Layout
  title="My Page Title"
  description="A detailed description of my page"
>
  <!-- Page content -->
</Layout>
```

### Available SEO Properties

The following properties can be included in the SEO object:

- `title`: The page title (appears in browser tabs and search results)
- `description`: A detailed description of the page (used in search results)
- `image`: The social sharing image URL (relative to public folder)
- `keywords`: Comma-separated list of keywords
- `canonical`: Custom canonical URL (defaults to current URL)
- `type`: Content type ('website', 'article', or 'product')
- `publishedTime`: For articles, when it was published (ISO string)
- `modifiedTime`: For articles, when it was last updated (ISO string)
- `author`: For articles, the author name
- `noindex`: Set to true to prevent indexing by search engines
- `nofollow`: Set to true to prevent following links on the page
- `structuredData`: Object containing schema.org structured data

## Using SEO Utilities

For more consistent SEO across similar pages, use the utilities in `src/utils/seo.ts`:

### Basic Page SEO

```astro
---
import Layout from "@/layouts/Layout.astro";
import { createSEO } from "@/utils/seo";

const seo = createSEO({
  pageName: "About Us",
  description: "Learn more about our company and team"
});
---

<Layout seo={seo}>
  <!-- Page content -->
</Layout>
```

### Service Page SEO

For service pages, use the `createServiceSEO` utility which automatically adds schema.org structured data:

```astro
---
import Layout from "@/layouts/Layout.astro";
import { createServiceSEO } from "@/utils/seo";

const seo = createServiceSEO({
  pageName: "Web Development",
  description: "Professional web development services",
  keywords: "web development, website creation, responsive design"
});
---

<Layout seo={seo}>
  <!-- Page content -->
</Layout>
```

### Blog Post SEO

For blog posts, we've implemented a specialized approach. The `BlogPost.astro` layout automatically uses the `createBlogSEO` utility to generate proper article structured data:

```astro
---
// In a content collection template that uses BlogPost.astro layout
import BlogPost from "@/layouts/BlogPost.astro";
import { getCollection } from "astro:content";

// The BlogPost layout automatically creates SEO metadata
// from the blog post frontmatter
---

<BlogPost {...post.data}>
  <Content />
</BlogPost>
```

This automatically generates:

- Proper article type schema.org structured data
- Article publication and modification dates
- Open Graph article metadata

If you need to customize a specific blog post's SEO, you can access the `createBlogSEO` utility directly:

```astro
---
import Layout from "@/layouts/Layout.astro";
import { createSEO } from "@/utils/seo";

const seo = createSEO({
  pageName: "How to Optimize Your Website",
  description: "Learn the best practices for website optimization",
  publishDate: new Date("2023-04-15"),
  updateDate: new Date("2023-05-20"),
  authorName: "Jane Smith",
  contentType: "blog",
  pathname: "/blog"
});
---

<Layout seo={seo}>
  <!-- Blog post content -->
</Layout>
```

## Modifying the Generated SEO Object

You can modify the SEO object before passing it to the Layout component:

```astro
---
import Layout from "@/layouts/Layout.astro";
import { createServiceSEO } from "@/utils/seo";

// Create the base SEO object
const seo = createServiceSEO({
  pageName: "Mobile App Development",
  description: "Professional mobile app development services"
});

// Modify or override specific properties
seo.keywords = "mobile apps, iOS apps, Android apps";
seo.image = "/images/custom-image.jpg";

// Override the structured data if needed
seo.structuredData = {
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Service",
  "name": "Custom Mobile App Development",
  "description": seo.description,
  // ...additional structured data
};
---

<Layout seo={seo}>
  <!-- Page content -->
</Layout>
```

## Best Practices

1. Always provide a unique title and description for each page
2. Keep titles under 60 characters
3. Keep descriptions between 120-160 characters
4. Use relevant keywords naturally in titles and descriptions
5. Provide high-quality images for social sharing (1200Ã—630 pixels recommended)
6. Use structured data when appropriate for your content type
7. Review your SEO implementation using tools like Google's Structured Data Testing Tool
