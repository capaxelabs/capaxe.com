**CLD Nine – Shopify Headless Integration Case Study**

CLD Nine, a supplement company that uses AI to generate personalized formulations for customers, approached us to migrate their existing website to Shopify. The project came with two major challenges:

1. Integrating their proprietary AI system with the new platform.
2. Enabling both **subscription-based** and **one-time purchases** for their products using Shopify.

### Our Solution

To meet the client's requirements, we implemented a **headless architecture** using **Next.js** for the frontend. This approach provided the flexibility and performance needed to deliver a seamless shopping experience.

* **AI System Integration**: We integrated CLD Nine’s AI engine into the headless Next.js application, allowing customers to generate tailored supplements through an intuitive interface.
* **Subscription & One-Time Purchase Support**: Using the **Shopify Subscription API**, we enabled recurring orders while also supporting traditional one-time purchases within the same product flow.
* **Custom Profile Management**: A personalized customer portal was developed where users can manage their subscriptions, view order history, and update account information.
* **Customer & Subscription Data**: With the **Shopify Customer API**, we fetched and displayed real-time data about each customer and their active subscriptions.
* **CRM Integration**: Order data is automatically synced with CLD Nine’s CRM system, helping the client track customer activity and streamline fulfillment.

### Technologies Used

* **Next.js**
* **Shopify Admin API**
* **Shopify Customer API**
* **Shopify Subscription API**
* **Cloudflare** – for secure, high-performance hosting
