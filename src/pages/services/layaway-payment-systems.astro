    question: "Do you build custom layaway payment systems for Shopify?",
    answer: "Yes. Capaxe Labs specializes in building custom layaway and installment payment systems for Shopify using Stripe ACH, Plaid, and custom payment orchestration. Our systems handle down payments, scheduled installments, inventory holds, automated payment collection, and full integration with Shopify checkout and order management."
  },
  {
    question: "How does a layaway payment system work on Shopify?",
    answer: "Our layaway system allows customers to reserve products with a down payment, then pay the remaining balance through scheduled installments. We integrate with Stripe ACH and Plaid for bank transfers, handle inventory holds, send automated payment reminders, process recurring payments, and release the product for shipping only after full payment is received."
  },
  {
    question: "What payment methods do you support for layaway?",
    answer: "We support Stripe ACH bank transfers via Plaid, credit/debit cards through Stripe, and custom payment schedules. Our system handles automated recurring billing, failed payment retry logic, and manual payment adjustments. We can integrate any payment provider that offers scheduled payment capabilities."
  },
  {
    question: "Can customers cancel layaway orders?",
    answer: "Yes. Our system includes configurable cancellation policies. You can set rules for refund amounts based on how far into the payment schedule the customer has progressed, apply cancellation fees, automatically release inventory, and handle partial refunds. All cancellation logic is customizable to your business requirements."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to build a layaway payment system?",
    answer: "A typical layaway system implementation takes 6-10 weeks depending on complexity. This includes payment gateway integration (Stripe, Plaid), custom payment schedule logic, Shopify integration, admin dashboard development, testing, and deployment. We provide a detailed timeline after understanding your specific requirements."
  },
  {
    question: "Does the layaway system work with Shopify Plus?",
    answer: "Yes. Our layaway systems work with both regular Shopify and Shopify Plus. For Shopify Plus merchants, we can integrate directly with checkout using Scripts and customize the checkout experience with additional payment schedule options and validation."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if a customer misses a payment?",
    answer: "Our system handles failed payments automatically with configurable retry logic. We send automated email reminders before due dates, retry failed ACH transfers multiple times, escalate to alternative payment methods if configured, pause order fulfillment, and can automatically cancel orders after a defined number of failed attempts."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I customize the payment schedule?",
    answer: "Yes. Our layaway system supports fully customizable payment schedules including weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, or custom intervals, configurable down payment amounts (percentage or fixed), flexible number of installments, grace periods for missed payments, and seasonal payment schedules. All scheduling logic is tailored to your business model."
