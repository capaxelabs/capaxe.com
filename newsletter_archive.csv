Let‚Äôs dive in ü§ø

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about:

## AI-Powered Design-to-Code: Figma MCP Beta Revolutionizes Shopify Development

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Hey Shopify friends,

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

What I've been thinking about this week is how the design-to-development gap is finally getting bridged in a meaningful way. After following the ecosystem closely, I've been watching how AI tools are reshaping our workflows, and this week's big news about Figma's MCP beta is exactly what we've been waiting for.

### Figma MCP Server Beta Release

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Figma just launched their Model Context Protocol (MCP) server beta, and it's a game-changer for Shopify developers. This tool lets AI agents like Cursor, VS Code, Windsurf, and Claude Code access design context directly from Figma files for precise code generation.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Key features:

- AI-Powered Code Generation: Feeds rich design context - auto-layouts, typography, component hierarchies - to AI tools, generating Liquid templates in seconds
- Code Connect Magic: Map Figma components directly to Liquid snippets, ensuring pixel-perfect consistency across themes
- Remote Access: No Figma desktop app needed - connect via browser or IDEs for seamless workflows
- Figma Make Integration: Extract interactions and animations, translate them into dynamic Liquid sections

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Thoughts:This is huge for Liquid developers. The 80% faster UI builds that X devs are reporting for simple Shopify pages using Figma ‚Üí MCP ‚Üí Cursor workflows is exactly what we need heading into Q4. It's not perfect - complex UIs can trip up the AI - but for rapid prototyping, it's a game-changer.

### Shopify's AI Commerce Push

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Shopify announced a partnership with OpenAI allowing merchants to sell products directly within ChatGPT conversations, enabling seamless purchases without redirects. This feature is rolling out soon and aims to embed commerce into AI interactions.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Key updates:

- Direct ChatGPT Sales: Merchants can sell single items directly in ChatGPT conversations
- Stock Performance: Shopify's stock rose over 6% on the news
- Strategic Alliance with ESW: Partnership for global expansion across 200+ markets
- Platform Updates: New UI APIs for announcement bars, themeDuplicate mutation for easier theme copying

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Thoughts:The timing is perfect. With Shopify pushing AI commerce and global scale, tools like Figma MCP become essential for developers who need to ship faster and adapt to these new touchpoints.

### MCP Security Alert: First Malicious Server Steals Emails

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

The Model Context Protocol ecosystem just hit a major security milestone - and it's not the good kind. Cybersecurity researchers discovered the first-ever malicious MCP server in the wild, and it's a sobering wake-up call for all of us using these tools.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

What happened:

- Malicious npm Package: A developer named ""phanpak"" uploaded a rogue ""postmark-mcp"" package that copied the official Postmark Labs library
- Stealthy Backdoor: Version 1.0.16 (released September 17) added a single line of code that BCC'd every email to ""phan@giftshop[.]club""
- Massive Impact: 1,643 downloads before the package was deleted, with emails being stolen for days
- Simple but Effective: ""One developer. One line of code. Thousands upon thousands of stolen emails.""

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

The attack details:

- Target: Email communications through MCP servers
- Method: Legitimate-looking package with hidden backdoor functionality
- Data Exposed: Password resets, invoices, customer communications, internal memos
- Discovery: Found by Koi Security, package since deleted from npm

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Thoughts:This was bound to happen, and it's a sobering reminder of the risks we face. The attack was embarrassingly simple but perfectly demonstrates how vulnerable the current MCP ecosystem is. MCP servers typically run with high trust and broad permissions, making them prime targets. For Shopify developers, this is especially concerning because we often handle sensitive customer data, payment information, and business communications.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

What we need to do immediately:

- Audit your MCP servers: Check every MCP tool you're using right now
- Verify package sources: Only use MCP servers from verified, official sources
- Rotate credentials: If you used any email-related MCP tools, rotate your credentials immediately
- Review email logs: Check for suspicious BCC traffic to unknown domains

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

The fact that major players like OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and tools like Replit and Sourcegraph are adopting MCP is exciting, but this security incident reminds us we're still in the wild west phase of AI tooling. One developer, one line of code, thousands of stolen emails. Stay vigilant, folks.

### Shopify‚Äôs Next-Gen Dev Platform & Polaris Updates: What Developers Should Know

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Hey Shopify friends, I‚Äôve been following Shopify‚Äôs ecosystem closely, and the past couple of weeks have brought some exciting changes. The big headline is theNext-Gen Dev Platform, which is starting to reshape how we build apps and manage stores. Here‚Äôs a breakdown from a dev perspective.

### Next-Gen Dev Platform

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Shopify has overhauled the developer experience, unifying app building, testing, and management into one streamlined workflow:

- Dev Dashboard: Replaces the old Partner Dashboard, centralizing app management, dev stores, and extensions in one hub.
- Shopify CLI (3.84+): Handles local coding, data modeling with TOML files (like for metaobjects), and one-command deploys.
- App Dev Preview: Test app and extension changes in isolated dev stores without full deploys.
- Unlimited Dev Stores: Create dev stores on any plan (including Plus) with generated test data mimicking real merchant setups.
- Collaboration Tools: Share access with partners or merchants easily.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Thoughts: The App Dev Preview and CLI improvements make iterating locally and testing in production-like environments much smoother. If you‚Äôve been avoiding the CLI, now‚Äôs the time to dive in¬† -¬† this is clearly Shopify‚Äôs core workflow going forward.

### Polaris Design System Updates

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Shopify has also introduced significant updates toPolaris, enhancing the development experience for building apps:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

New ComponentsEight new unified components are now available for Shopify Admin

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Migration to Web ComponentsPolaris is now based on web components, unifying the design system across Admin, Checkout, and Customer Accounts. This ensures a consistent UI across the Shopify ecosystem.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Version 12 Enhancements

- New Admin Design Language ‚Äì Refined visual language
- Refined Tokens ‚Äì Updated design tokens for better customization
- Aligned Component APIs ‚Äì Standardized APIs for easier integration
- Updated Figma UI Kit ‚Äì Enhanced resources for designers

### Other Updates Worth Knowing

- Shopify Plus Multi-Account Management‚Äì Manage multiple stores from one hub using tools like Unify for inventory and order sync.
- POS v10.2+‚Äì Supports store credits for payments/returns and syncs with Facebook orders.
- Flow Data Hashing‚Äì Secure sensitive data (PII, API keys) with new hashing support.
- Announcement Bar Extensions‚Äì Add promos or updates to Customer Accounts and Thank You pages.
- ‚ÄúShop‚Äù Feature on X‚Äì Upload photos to get shareable captions for customer engagement.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Thoughts: Multi-store management is a pain point for many Plus clients, so having one hub and sync tools baked in is a huge time-saver. Flow hashing shows Shopify tightening up data security, which becomes more important as merchants scale.

Super helpful for testing Next-Gen Platform migrations from older systems like WooCommerce.

### One learning as a freelancer:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I suggest everyone hop into a dev store and test the new Dev Platform for themselves. The CLI flow, App Dev Preview, and unlimited dev stores are big shifts¬† -¬† and the sooner you get hands-on, the easier it‚Äôll be to adapt your current and future projects. Even if you‚Äôre not actively migrating, it‚Äôs worth exploring now so you‚Äôre not caught off guard later.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Let‚Äôs dive in ü§ø

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about:

### Remix v3: A Lean, AI-Powered Leap for Web Development

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Every now and then, a framework comes along that makes you rethink the way you build for the web. Remix v3 is one of those moments. Still in development, it‚Äôs already shaping up to be leaner, faster, and smarter - and for Shopify developers, it‚Äôs worth following closely.Remix v3 is still in development, and we‚Äôre hearing updates straight from the creators themselves. This isn‚Äôt just another version release - it‚Äôs an attempt to rethink what a framework can be at its core. For Shopify developers its especially important to watch closely. Shopify acquired Remix a couple years ago,, and that means its evolution is tied directly to Shopify‚Äôs long-term vision for headless commerce and the developer experience around it.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

The Remix team is going back to fundamentals. They‚Äôre moving to a Preact fork, stripping out heavy dependencies, and building around web standards. The end goal is a framework that feels less like a bulky layer on top of the web and more like an extension of JavaScript itself. For Shopify developers, that could translate into:

- Faster storefronts with fewer performance bottlenecks
- Cleaner API integrations with the Storefront API, Admin API, or Hydrogen services
- Reduced overhead, making projects easier to maintain long-term

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

But perhaps the most striking shift ishow v3 is being built. Much of the framework‚Äôs code is being written with AI, then carefully refined by the same developers who gave us Remix and React Router. This hybrid approach - AI speed plus human judgment - aims to deliver a minimal API that is intuitive, powerful, and focused. For Shopify developers juggling multiple storefronts or client projects, that could mean fewer moving parts to manage and a framework that adapts smoothly to business logic like products, carts, and checkout flows.

### The Component Model and Shopify‚Äôs Modular Future

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Another key change in v3 is its component model. It takes what‚Äôs useful from React but shifts toward a more web-native approach. Why does that matter for Shopify? Because Shopify‚Äôs ecosystem itself is modular. You‚Äôre already working with APIs, extensions, and isolated parts of the platform - so a lean, modular framework is a natural fit.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

When combined with tools likeShopify MCP (Modular Component Platform), Remix v3 could become a developer‚Äôs best friend for assembling API-driven storefronts. Imagine plugging Remix‚Äôs minimal components directly into a storefront that talks seamlessly with Shopify APIs - fast, flexible, and much less boilerplate.

### The Shopify Angle: Why This Isn‚Äôt Just Another Framework

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

It‚Äôs easy to see frameworks come and go, but this one is different because Shopify owns Remix. That means Shopify has a vested interest in making sure it succeeds, particularly as the company pushes further into headless commerce, Hydrogen, and flexible storefront solutions. Remix v3 isn‚Äôt just an experiment - it‚Äôs part of Shopify‚Äôs broader strategy to give developers better tools for building commerce experiences without being locked into rigid templates.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

For Shopify developers, this is huge. It signals that the future of Shopify development won‚Äôt just be Liquid themes and apps - it will also be about modern, headless architectures powered by frameworks like Remix. By experimenting with v3 early, you‚Äôre not just learning a new tool, you‚Äôre aligning with where Shopify itself is heading.

### The Road Ahead: Early But Promising

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Of course, Remix v3 isn‚Äôt ready for production yet. The AI-driven approach is groundbreaking, but it will take refinement to deliver the kind of polished developer experience we expect. That‚Äôs where early adopters come in. Shopify developers who test, experiment, and give feedback will be directly influencing how this framework takes shape.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

That‚Äôs the exciting part: we‚Äôre not just waiting for a release - we‚Äôre watching and shaping a tool being built in real time. And because Remix is Shopify-owned, the feedback loop between developers and Shopify is tighter than with almost any other framework.

### Takeaway for Shopify Developers

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

If you‚Äôre working on storefronts, apps, or custom integrations, keep Remix v3 on your radar.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

The framework is still in development, but that‚Äôs exactly why it matters now. The earlier you experiment, the better positioned you‚Äôll be when v3 becomes the backbone of Shopify‚Äôs headless stack.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Let‚Äôs dive in ü§ø

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about:

### Last week Shopify MCP shipped an update for Liquid.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Everyone has already seen the new Shopify editor, but in my view,it only becomes genuinely useful once it has full agent or MCP support. Without that, it's still limited in providing accurate code suggestions, API context, or validation, which means most of the benefits we expect from AI-assisted development just don't materialize.

### Why MCP/Agents are worth attention:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

For me,MCP/Agents has become one of the most useful toolswhen working with Shopify. Most AI-assisted coding fails on Shopify projects because the model doesn't have the right context about Liquid, the API schema, or object patterns.MCP fixes thatby giving the model the actual definitions and documentation. When you ask it to generate Liquid or make an API call, it's pulling from the real Shopify ecosystem instead of guessing.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

It's also very effective withShopify Functions. MCP always provides the latest Function API docs and type definitions, which makes writing Rust or JavaScript handlers faster, more accurate, and less likely to break after updates.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

That said, MCP doesn't always behave exactly as you'd want. Sometimes it gives you something close but not quite right. In those cases, it's worth leaning on more specific tool calling - for example, usingshopify_admin_graphqlfor exact mutations,introspect_graphql_schemato check field availability, orvalidate_graphql_codeblocksto confirm queries. You can also pull in documentation directly withlearn_shopify_api,fetch_full_docs, orsearch_docs_chunkswhen you need precise references instead of relying on a generic prompt.

## My Rules for Pain-Free Development:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Here's my rules suggestion to make development less painful. Following these guidelines helps reduce errors, speeds up iteration, and keeps your theme organized and maintainable. It's all about building a workflow where Liquid, sections, snippets, and APIs work together smoothly, so you spend less time troubleshooting and more time shipping features that actually work.

###¬† **Available MCP Tools**

Use these MCP tools to get the latest up-to-date data:

| Tool | Purpose |

|------|---------|

| introspect_graphql_schema | Explore Shopify's GraphQL schema structure |

| learn_shopify_api | Get knowledge about Shopify's APIs |

| search_docs_chunks | Search through Shopify developer documentation |

| fetch_full_docs | Retrieve complete documentation pages |

| validate_graphql_codeblocks | Validate GraphQL code against schemas |

| shopify_admin_graphql | Write accurate Admin API operations |

### üîç **MCP Validation Rules**

- ** MCP Check:** Verify your development environment and tools are up to date by querying the latest Shopify API versions and documentation schemas using Shopify MCP tools.

- ** MCP Check:** Check the validity of snippet and block parameters, descriptions, and examples to ensure they align with the defined LiquidDoc standard.

¬†¬†**Rule:** **Enable and use LiquidDoc in snippets and blocks.** This is a native Shopify feature that adds structured documentation to your reusable components, making your code easier to read and validate. **Do not use LiquidDoc in sections**, as it isn't supported there. Section settings and documentation are handled by the schema.json file.

- ** MCP Check:** Analyze the theme's file and directory structure to ensure it follows a modular, organized pattern with clear separation between sections, snippets, and templates.

¬†¬†**Rule:** Maintain a clean, logical file structure. Break down themes into a modular architecture using sections and snippets. Store reusable components (like headers or product cards) in snippets to reduce redundancy and improve maintainability.

- ** MCP Check:** Run a comprehensive validation of all theme files, checking for syntax errors, security vulnerabilities, and adherence to established best practices.

- ** MCP Check:** Evaluate code for readability, consistency, and adherence to naming conventions and commenting standards.

¬†¬†**Rule:** **Write clean, readable code.**

¬†¬†¬†¬†- Maintain consistent code formatting and indentation.

¬†¬†¬†¬†- Use meaningful variable names that are easy to understand.

¬†¬†¬†¬†- Add inline comments to explain complex logic or unique functionality.

- ** MCP Check:** Scan Liquid templates for common error-prone patterns, such as trying to access properties on a potentially nil object.

¬†¬†**Rule:** **Implement robust error handling.** Always check if objects or arrays exist before trying to display data (e.g., {% if collection.products.size > 0 %}). Use blank or empty instead of empty strings to handle nil values correctly.

- ** MCP Check:** Query the theme's schema and Liquid to ensure it effectively uses Online Store 2.0 features like JSON templates and metafields.

- ** Remember that Liquid can't access query parameters directly - you'll need to use Shopify's built-in objects and filters. Always compare Liquid logic with Shopify MCP tools before deploying.`

## Agentic Development Tips

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Pro Tip:Large files can easily confuse agents, making suggestions less accurate or even wrong.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

By breaking your theme into well-named snippets and clear sections, you not only keep your code neat but also make it easier for MCP/Agents to understand context and provide precise recommendations.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Additionally, keeping a Markdown (.md) file that documents big logic changes or complex workflows helps agents follow your intent more accurately. When everything is clearly explained and tracked, MCP/Agents can reference it for better suggestions, reducing errors and misunderstandings.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

When you revisit a project months later, you'll immediately know where to make changes. Combined with accurate context from MCP/Agents, this approach gives you a smart assistant plus a clean workflow, letting you focus on building features and improving UX instead of chasing bugs or syntax issues.

## Key Setup Steps:

- Install the Shopify Liquid extension in Cursor
- Add this.cursorrulesfile to your theme root
- Enable Shopify CLI theme check for validation
- Use Cursor's AI with specific Shopify context prompts

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Let‚Äôs dive in ü§ø

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about: Liquid & Site Speed & Loops

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

My first Shopify agency hired only front-end developers. It was a great team with some sharp minds and one very, very misguided belief: if it happens on the server, it‚Äôs fast.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Liquid can beslow, as we learned when one team built a client a ‚Äúsuper collections‚Äù page that showed twenty collections with just over fifty products each. Before the page would even start loading, the browser would spend a full twenty seconds thinking about it.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I was the developer who got to diagnose and fix the issue.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

It turns out, it was the nested loops. Servers are fast, but if you‚Äôre looping through twenty collections with fifty products each and each of those products has ten variants with a variant metafield that has ten images each - that‚Äôs 100k things the server has to get through.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Since then, Liquid‚Äôs gotten a lot faster, but the memories of that site remain: to me, loops are still no good very bad things to be avoided atallcosts. Here‚Äôs how I do that.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Do it Ten Times:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Say I need to generate a gallery of ten identical images for each variant on our super collections page. Because we‚Äôre writing good code, it makes the most sense to do this:

`{% for collection in super_collections_array %}
 {% for product in collection.products %}
   {% for variant in product.variants %}
     {% for j in (1..10) %}
       {% assign collection = variant_image_array[j] %}<imgsrc=‚Äùwww.imageurl.com‚Äùdata-etc=‚Äùotherstuff‚Äù/>{% endfor %}
   {% endfor %}
 {% endfor %}
{% endfor %}`
p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

But because we‚Äôre avoiding nested loops and we know we‚Äôve got 10 variant images, this is a better choice for site speed:

`{% for collection in super_collections_array %}
 {% for product in collection.products %}
   {% for variant in product.variants %}
     {% assign image = variant_image_array[1] %}<imgsrc=‚Äùwww.imageurl.com‚Äùdata-etc=‚Äùotherstuff‚Äù/>{% assign image = variant_image_array[2] %}<imgsrc=‚Äùwww.imageurl.com‚Äùdata-etc=‚Äùotherstuff‚Äù/>{% assign image = variant_image_array[3] %}<imgsrc=‚Äùwww.imageurl.com‚Äùdata-etc=‚Äùotherstuff‚Äù/>...
      etc.
   {% endfor %}
 {% endfor %}
{% endfor %}`
p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

If we have to change anything in the image, we‚Äôve gotta do it ten times. Let‚Äôs make a separate snippet for the image that looks like this:

`{% assign image = variant_image_array[i] %}<imgsrc=‚Äùwww.imageurl.com‚Äùdata-etc=‚Äùotherstuff‚Äù/>`
p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

And use it as follows:

`{% for collection in super_collections_array %}
 {% for product in collection.products %}
   {% for variant in product.variants %}
     {% render 'separate-image-snippet', i: 1 %}
     {% render 'separate-image-snippet', i: 2 %}
     {% render 'separate-image-snippet', i: 3 %}
       ...
       etc.
   {% endfor %}
 {% endfor %}
{% endfor %}`
p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Now we‚Äôve cut one nested loop out, but it‚Äôs not difficult to edit the image if we need to.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Use Capture:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Say you‚Äôre on a PDP. You‚Äôve got variant images, variant swatches, variant-specific ingredients, descriptions, and so on.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

You can loop through your variants every single time you‚Äôre rendering one of these things as shown in this very shorthand code block:

`<product-images>{% for variant in product.variants %}<img/>{% endfor %}</product-images><product-swatches>{% for variant in product.variants %}<swatch/>{% endfor %}</product-swatches><product-ingredients>{% for variant in product.variants %}<ingredients/>{% endfor %}</product-ingredients><product-descriptions>{% for variant in product.variants %}<descriptions/>{% endfor %}</product-descriptions>`
p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

But we can replace these four loops with one:

`{% liquid
 assign product_images = ''
 assign product_swatches = ''
 assign product_ingredients = ''
 assign product_description = '' %}

{% for variant in product variants %}
 {% capture product_images %}
   {{ product_images }}<img/>{% endcapture %}

 {% capture product_swatches %}
   {{ product_swatches }}<swatch/>{% endcapture %}

 {% capture product_ingredients %}
   {{ product_ingredients }}<ingredients/>{% endcapture %}

 {% capture product_descriptions %}
   {{ product_descriptions }}<descriptions/>{% endcapture %}

 {% endfor %}<product-images>{{ product_images }}</product-images><product-swatches>{{ product_swatches }}</product-swatches><product-ingredients>{{ product_ingredients }}</product-ingredients><product-descriptions>{{ product_descriptions }}</product-descriptions>`
p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I especially like this format because it lets me get an overview of the structure of the page.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Hopefully this gives you something to think about!

Let‚Äôs dive in ü§ø

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

When should you throw out your theme?

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I recently worked with a client who had abadtheme.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

None of his settings were connected. Half his sections were broken and the other half didn‚Äôt do what he needed. Something as simple as promoting a holiday sale was a nightmare. He didn‚Äôt have a huge budget; he just needed something that worked.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

There are a million reasons a brand might have a terrible theme. Sometimes they‚Äôve had a million different freelancers building features here or there over the years, or app developers making changes to their theme that don‚Äôt get removed when the app is, or an agency that made a weird decision early on or a thousand other things that aren‚Äôt really anyone‚Äôs fault - they just happened.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Point is, bad themes happen. There are only two ways of dealing with them. Option one - fixing the theme. Option two - throwing everything out and starting over.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

For a long time, my recommendation was always to fix the existing theme. This lets the client set the pace of updates based on their timeline and budget. There‚Äôs no risk of missing a key integration or accidentally breaking a marketing pixel. They don‚Äôt need to learn to use new settings or features or migrate specially formatted content over to custom metafields and metaobjects.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Then I worked with Mr. Bad Theme. It was the first time I strongly encouraged a client to start over using a theme store theme without a second thought - and for him, it was a game changer.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

It got me thinking about what made it such a huge win for him:

- His goal was to be able to make simple content updates without a developer.
- He had limited templates and content that needed to be migrated to the new theme.
- The next big holiday for his brand was far enough out that there was time to get everything up and running well in advance.
- He didn‚Äôt have any complex custom features. Things I look out for are bundling, specialty promotions (like a gift with purchase in the cart), gated products, quantity limits, or anything that‚Äôs not immediately clear what it does.
- There wasn‚Äôt a lot of design customization outside fonts and brand patterns, so it was easy to keep the brand consistent while giving it a little more polish.
- He was the sole business owner. There was no larger organization he folded up under or history of the site he was missing; if he didn‚Äôt know about it, it wasn‚Äôt being used.
- He had a realistic budget for what he needed. In this case, his budget was tight, but his needs were so straight forward that a fresh theme could do everything he wanted out of the box - he just needed the labor to get it set up.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

So ultimately, it aligned with his longterm goals, budget, and timeline. I was able to make a really great recommendation for his needs instead of investing a ton of time in something that was never going to be perfect for him.

If my client has the budget for a fully-customized theme built exactly to their brand‚Äôs specifications, that‚Äôs incredible - I love giving it to them.

Let‚Äôs dive in ü§ø

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Developing for A/B Tests - Quick, Ugly, Out the Door

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I recently had another developer ask about how I code features for A/B tests like it was some kind of forbidden knowledge.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

It‚Äôs not.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Let‚Äôs get into it.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

First (and most obvious): if you can build it in the tool, build it there. Usually these tests involve hiding elements, swapping out text and images, changing CSS.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

But what if you need to make bigger changes to functionality?

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Let‚Äôs say our client wants to increase subscriptions, so they want to test splitting the CTA for subscriptions and one-time purchases into two separate buttons:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }
p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }
p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

That‚Äôs probably going to take some Liquid, some CSS, and - depending on the theme - some changes to core JS functionality (adding to cart). We could probably figure this out entirely in our client‚Äôs A/B testing tool of choice, but it‚Äôs going to be a lot quicker and cleaner to build if we make changes to the code base instead.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Because most A/B tests fail, we should approach the actual work a little differently:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Focus on the MVP

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

If the test loses, any extra time you spent writing production-quality code, hooking up theme settings, getting those sleek animations perfect? Wasted.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Code A/B tests like a maniac ‚Äî hardcode that text, inline that CSS, add your script tag right there in the Liquid. It‚Äôs ugly, it‚Äôs messy, it‚Äôd be unsustainable if this was production code. We all know better, but this is an A/B test. It‚Äôs not about perfection. It‚Äôs about figuring out if this thing is even worth exploring before sinking in the time to go from ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù to ‚Äúperfect‚Äù.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Separate your Code

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

If the test loses, we‚Äôre going to remove it; if the test wins, we‚Äôre going to refactor it. Make it easy to find. I like to keep any code for an A/B test in separate snippets prefixed with a key unique to that test.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Hide it by Default

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

When the page loads, the code for your feature should be on there, hidden. Then, when you build the actual test variation in your client‚Äôs A/B testing tool, simply show the feature using CSS.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

That‚Äôs it! Hopefully this is helpful to you as you build out those A/B tests!

Always come back to what your client is actually trying to solve for.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

For example, sometimes the folks I‚Äôm working with want redesigns launched as A/B tests - think new templates like a product page, collection, home page or new features like an inline cart or nav menu.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

With these types of large-scale changes, ‚Äúget it out the door‚Äù may not be the right approach. It‚Äôs best to have a conversation with the client to understand where (if anywhere) to cut time.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Are they going to launch this feature whether or not it wins the test? How do they feel about you spending more time to polish before running the test ‚Äî or spending some extra time to polish the feature after (if it wins)? And why are they running this as a test - are they unsure about the design? Do they want to prove its value to someone higher up who wants numbers?

All relevant to the decisions you‚Äôre making at the top of the project - and none of them answers that come out unless you ask the right questions.

Let‚Äôs dive in ü§ø

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Theme Block Nesting Architecture or ‚Äî just because you can, doesn‚Äôt mean you should

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Several years ago, I moved all of the data for a client‚Äôs Shopify store into Contentful. It was my first time being able to structure content however I wanted - so I organized it like a developer. Pages contained sections contained components contained components contained components contained‚Ä¶

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

You get the idea.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

It wasn‚Äôt until merchandising got in there that I learned I‚Äôd created a monster.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I recently built a new theme for one of my clients using theme blocks and got to work on . They‚Äôre powerful and useful and subject to the same pitfalls, so I‚Äôve been stewing on how things can get out of hand - and how to avoid it.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Say you‚Äôre breaking this slider section design into blocks. How would you do it?

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

At the top level, it‚Äôs obvious - you‚Äôve got a section with a title lockup header, a footer with a CTA, and a slider in the middle:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

The title lockup has a bunch of heading styles; let‚Äôs break each line into a block, Dawn-style. Plus that button in the footer should definitely have its own block. And those product cards in the slider? Blocks.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Since there are a few different ways the product cards can look and you want to give your client maximum control, you make each line a theme block. Now your product tiles have theme blocks for a star rating, heading, subheading, short description, price, quick buy - and what if they wanna put the image on the bottom? Better make it a block too.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Now your client can move these around in whatever order they want, add them as needed, remove them, double up, etc. It‚Äôs powerful, and it gives them a ton of control. Amazing. Right‚Ä¶?

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Let‚Äôs take that control even further and getreallygranular.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

We need to set a max width on the section in a sane way - make it a block.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

We need complete background color control - make it a block.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

It can get crazyfast.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Before you know it, you‚Äôve architected a theme that forces your client to click through 5 levels of blocks so they can change a heading - and some of these theme blocks are so granular you‚Äôre not even going to be able to reuse them. Updating settings takes a lot of extra time and - even with presets - effort. Down this road liesmadness.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

If we put ourselves in the shoes of the merchandiser who got the Big Holiday Sale assets late who now needs to put them in a theme that‚Äôs going live in an hour to promote said Big Holiday Sale - what do we actually need to control?

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

The text on top, what collection the products are coming from, where the Shop All button goes and what it says - so let‚Äôs streamline:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

This breaks the section down into relatively complex theme blocks we‚Äôll definitely reuse. Most sections will probably have the heading lockup, buttons are everywhere, and product cards will at the very least exist in grid form on your collection pages.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

These theme blocks are also complex enough that it makes sense to put them in their own buckets instead of copy-pasting the same set of settings across a bunch of different sections.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

The client has less control, but they‚Äôre not dealing with buckets of buckets of buckets of blocks every time they need to make a change - and by focusing on the controls that really matter, we‚Äôre letting the client spend their time setting up promos.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

For the pieces that are repeatable - a slider, a max width, a background color, a heading - we can use snippets to keep things consistent on our end without surfacing nuts and bolts that the client doesn‚Äôt need to wade through every time they go to make a change.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Obviously, this isn‚Äôt a one-size-fits-all approach. I recently got to work on a project where the client wanted all the control (and had the resources to take full advantage of it). I‚Äôm proposing a default starting point. Theme blocks are an awesome step forward for Liquid theme development; let‚Äôs keep things sane.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Let‚Äôs dive in ü§ø

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

In my previous entry ofI Only Speak Liquid, I explored how Alpine.js simplifies building accessible UI components. This time, I‚Äôd like to dive deeper into another powerful aspect of Alpine.js‚Äîmanaging global state within your Shopify themes. By leveraging Alpine‚Äôs global store functionality, you can effectively handle common UI states like menus, search bars, and shopping carts with minimal effort and complexity.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Let's begin by creating an Alpine store calledglobal, where we'll initialize our shared state and define methods to update it.

### Step 1: Creating a Global Alpine Store

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Here's how you set up an Alpine global store:

`document.addEventListener('alpine:init', () => {
  Alpine.store('global', {
    menuOpen: false,
    searchOpen: false,
    toggleMenu() {
      this.menuOpen = !this.menuOpen;
      this.searchOpen = false;
    },
    toggleSearch() {
      this.searchOpen = !this.searchOpen;
      this.menuOpen = false;
    },
  });
});`
p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

When Alpine initialized,[Alpine.store](https://Alpine.store?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-76-global-state-with-alpine)()will run and set values for handling common state we might encounter in a Shopify theme. The benefit here is huge since any state changes are easily maintained from a single source, making our code much more manageable.

### Step 2: Accessing Global Store in Liquid Markup

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Once the store is set up, we can effortlessly access the global state across your Shopify theme using Alpine‚Äôs$storemagic property:

`<div><button@click=""$store.global.toggleMenu()"":aria-expanded=""$store.global.menuOpen""aria-controls=""main-menu""class=""transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"":class=""$store.global.searchOpen ? 'text-black/50' : 'text-black'"">Menu</button><button@click=""$store.global.toggleSearch()"":aria-expanded=""$store.global.searchOpen""aria-controls=""search""class=""transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"":class=""$store.global.menuOpen ? 'text-black/50' : 'text-black'"">Search</button><divid=""main-menu""x-show=""$store.global.menuOpen""x-cloak><ul><li><ahref=""#"">Home</a></li><li><ahref=""#"">Products</a></li><li><ahref=""#"">About</a></li><li><ahref=""#"">Contact</a></li></ul></div><divid=""search""x-show=""$store.global.searchOpen""x-cloak><form@submit.prevent=""alert('Search submitted!')""><div><inputtype=""text""placeholder=""Search for products...""name=""search""><buttontype=""submit"">Search</button></div></form></div></div>`

### Step 3: What‚Äôs Happening Here?

- Event Listeners:The methodstoggleMenu()andtoggleSearch()from the store are used directly as click handlers, centralizing control.
- Dynamic ARIA Attributes:Accessibility attributes (aria-expanded) dynamically reflect the UI state
- Dynamic Styling:Using Tailwind CSS utility classes, button colors are dynamically adjusted to visually indicate when another element is active.
- Conditional Rendering:x-showdirectives manage visibility based on the corresponding global state properties.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

With Alpine‚Äôs global store, maintaining complex UI interactions becomes streamlined, reducing redundancy and making your Shopify theme development more efficient.

Let‚Äôs GO üìö

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Dynamic sources are a powerful tool for giving merchants greater flexibility and control over the custom sections and themes Shopify developers build. One of my favorite aspects is that they allow merchants to take regular section files and then pipe dynamic data into them when they are placed in product or collection pages. Store owners with moderate technical proficiency can create their own metafields and metaobjects to inject customized data directly into new sections on their PDP or PLP, all without the help of a developer. in this article I'll demonstrate how to use a custom metaobject to dynamically populate a specific section on a PDP.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Let's start by defining a section schema for a ""Timeline"" section. This section includes a heading and supports up to three ""Timeline Steps.‚Äù

`{% schema %}
{
  ""name"": ""Timeline"",
  ""tag"": ""section"",
  ""max_blocks"": 3,

We can include this section on a PDP without dynamic sources, but the content will be static and won‚Äôt show unique data for each product. Let‚Äôs create a custom metaobject meant to store all of the structured data required to populate this section on a PDP.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Here, we have a metaobject called ‚ÄúProduct Timeline‚Äù meant to store timeline data specific to individual products. It includes fields for the section heading and three ""Timeline Steps,"" each consisting of ""Phase Title"" and ""Phase Details.‚Äù

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Next, we'll create a Product metafield that references our new ""Product Timeline"" metaobject. This metafield allows each product to store its unique timeline data.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

To implement this on a PDP, we'll add our ""Timeline"" section to the product page and link its fields to our metaobject through dynamic sources:

- For the heading, click the dynamic source icon and select:Product Template ‚Üí Product Timeline ‚Üí Heading.

- For each timeline step, add a block and similarly connect each block's fields (titleanddetails) to their corresponding ""Phase Title"" and ""Phase Details"" fields in the metaobject.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Once everything is wired up, the PDP will feature a dynamically populated ""Timeline"" section tailored uniquely to each product.

Let‚Äôs GO üìö

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

As Shopify developers, it‚Äôs our responsibility to ensure that the theme‚Äôs we build can be used by everyone. If you're new to developing with accessibility in mind, managing ARIA attributes, roles, keyboard navigation, and focus behavior can feel quite daunting. Enter Alpine.js - a lightweight javascript framework for composing behavior directly in your markup, and in our case, directly within liquid templates (thank you Caleb Porzio!). While I‚Äôm a huge fan of Alpine for many reasons, in this article, I thought I‚Äôd highlight how easy it can make creating accessible UI.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

First things first, you need to install Alpine in your project. I won‚Äôt go into details, but you can refer to[Alpine‚Äôs documentation here](https://alpinejs.dev/essentials/installation?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-74-accessible-interactivity-alpine-js-liquid). I‚Äôll also be discussing theFocusplugin. You can find the[documentation for that here](https://alpinejs.dev/plugins/focus?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-74-accessible-interactivity-alpine-js-liquid).

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Let‚Äôs take a look at an example of a dropdown navigation menu to show how simple it is to manage aria attributes and focus with Alpine.

### Basic HTML & Alpine Setup

`<navx-data=""{ open: false }""><button@click=""open = !open"":aria-expanded=""open""aria-haspopup=""menu""aria-controls=""dropdown-menu""class=""nav-button"">Menu</button><ulid=""dropdown-menu""role=""menu""x-show=""open""x-trap=""open""@keydown.escape.window=""open = false""@click.outside=""open = false""class=""dropdown-menu""><li><ahref=""/""role=""menuitem"">Home</a></li><li><ahref=""/collections""role=""menuitem"">Collections</a></li><li><ahref=""/about""role=""menuitem"">About</a></li></ul></nav>`

### Understanding the Alpine.js Syntax

- x-data: Initializes a new Alpine component, holding the reactive state. Here, it's used to track whether the dropdown menu (open) is visible or hidden.
- @click: Sets up an event listener for clicks. In our case, it toggles the dropdown‚Äôs visibility by changing the value ofopen.
- x-show: Conditionally shows or hides an element based on a state variable. In this example, it reveals the dropdown menu only whenopenis true.
- @click.outside: Detects clicks outside the specified element and updates the Alpine state

### Accessibility Enhancements

- :aria-expanded: The colon (:) beforearia-expandedindicates that it is dynamically bound to the Alpine state. It automatically updates based on the value ofopen, clearly communicating the dropdown‚Äôs visibility state to assistive technology.
- aria-haspopup: Communicates to assistive technology that the button triggers additional interactive content.
- aria-controls: Clearly indicates the element controlled by the button, helping screen readers understand the relationship.
- x-trap: Automatically traps keyboard navigation within the dropdown when open, ensuring users can't accidentally navigate away and get lost on the page. I‚Äôve used this on tons of primary navigation menus, custom cart drawers, modals, etc.
- @keydown.escape.window: Enables users to close the menu using the escape key.

### Why Alpine Works Great with Liquid

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Alpine works great with Shopify themes because of its minimal setup, tiny footprint, and straightforward syntax. It‚Äôs the perfect complement to Liquid. It makes it incredibly easy to handle user interactions and manage state in your UI. Once you‚Äôve got the basics down, you can go pretty deep with Alpine by incorporating stores, custom directives, magics, and the rest of the available plugins.

Accessibility adds value.Clients increasingly value accessibility‚Äînot only as a compliance necessity but as a reflection of their brand values. Positioning yourself as a developer who understands accessibility can significantly set you apart. During scoping conversations, I like to make it known that I have acted as the engineering lead on ADA audits for clients in the past. If you can tackle a significant percentage of common accessibility during your initial build, you are saving the client time, energy and money down the line. If you‚Äôre trying to value-price your projects, it can help you capture the project at a higher premium.

Let‚Äôs GO üìö

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I love the early stages of building a new project. It gives me time to reflect on my previous work, identify areas where my processes can become more efficient, iterate through the next development cycle, and repeat. It feels great to find things you can pinpoint to improve and get a productivity boost. Theme blocks have the potential to drastically increase development time and improve codebase maintainability.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Theme blocks are a recent addition to the Shopify developer‚Äôs toolkit, officially released in Shopify Winter 2025‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Boring Edition.‚Äù They introduce a wealth of possibilities for incorporating reusable components into themes. I've been hoping for something like this since the early days of my theme development career, and I'm thrilled that Shopify has finally made them available.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

One of the first reusable blocks I've started integrating into my custom themes is a ""button"" block. Buttons often have numerous settings reused across different sections, making them an excellent candidate.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

To implement theme blocks in your codebase, you'll need to create ablocksfolder at the root of your directory.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Let‚Äôs look at an example of how you could set up a simple button theme block.

`{% comment %} /blocks/button.liquid {% endcomment %}

{% if block.settings.button_text != blank %}<ahref=""{{ block.settings.button_url }}""class=""block-btn {{ block.settings.button_type }} {{ block.settings.button_color }}"">{{- block.settings.button_text -}}</a>{% endif %}

{% schema %}
{
  ""name"": ""Button"",
  ""tag"": null,
  ""settings"": [
    {
      ""type"": ""header"",
      ""content"": ""Settings""
    },
    {
      ""type"": ""text"",
      ""id"": ""button_text"",
      ""label"": ""Button Text"",
      ""info"": ""The text for the button""
    },
    {
      ""type"": ""url"",
      ""id"": ""button_url"",
      ""label"": ""Button URL"",
      ""info"": ""The URL for the button""
    },
    {
      ""type"": ""header"",
      ""content"": ""Button Styles""
    },
    {
      ""type"": ""select"",
      ""id"": ""button_type"",
      ""label"": ""Button Type"",
      ""default"": ""btn--primary"",
      ""options"": [
        {
          ""value"": ""btn--primary"",
          ""label"": ""Primary""
        },
        {
          ""value"": ""btn--secondary"",
          ""label"": ""Secondary""
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      ""type"": ""select"",
      ""id"": ""button_color"",
      ""label"": ""Button Color"",
      ""default"": ""dark"",
      ""options"": [
        {
          ""value"": ""dark"",
          ""label"": ""Dark""
        },
        {
          ""value"": ""light"",
          ""label"": ""Light""
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  ""presets"": [{ ""name"": ""Button"" }]
}
{% endschema %}`
p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

This is great ‚Äî we‚Äôve encapsulated all the settings within a single liquid file that can be reused within sections and other theme blocks. Another bonus ‚Äî if we need to update options for all buttons throughout the theme, we can refactor just thebutton.liquidfile, and changes automatically propagate everywhere it's used.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

There are two ways we can go ahead and start using the button theme block in our code ‚Äìdynamicallyorstatically. I will give a brief overview for each, but I would recommend reading[Shopify‚Äôs official documentation](https://shopify.dev/docs/storefronts/themes/architecture/blocks/theme-blocks/quick-start?framework=liquid&utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-73-theme-blocks-for-reusability) about theme blocks for an in-depth understanding.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Dynamic Blocks

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

You‚Äôll want to ensure your schema includes the theme blocks you‚Äôd like to give the merchant as options. You can add multiple theme blocks to the blocks array, but you cannot intermingle section-defined blocks and theme blocks. Here‚Äôs how we add the button theme block usingblock targetingand render the blocks with liquid**.**

`{% content_for 'blocks' %}

{% schema %}
{
  ""name"": ""Section"",
  ""blocks"": [{""type"": ""button""}]
}
{% endschema %}`
p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Static Blocks

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

When rendering blocks statically, adding the theme block to the blocks array is optional. Here's how to render a button theme block statically without including it in the blocks array:

`{% content_for 'block', type: 'button', id: 'button' %}

{% schema %}
{
  ""name"": ""Section"",
}
{% endschema %}`
p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

And here‚Äôs how you could render two static buttons.

`{% content_for 'block', type: 'button', id: 'button-1' %}
{% content_for 'block', type: 'button', id: 'button-2' %}

{% schema %}
{
  ""name"": ""Section"",
}
{% endschema %}`
p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Shopify theme blocks offer immense potential and are a powerful new tool for Shopify developers. I encourage you to experiment with them and discover how they can enhance your development workflow.

Don‚Äôt be afraid to pivot. One of the biggest challenges in scoping new Shopify projects is anticipating unknown issues. The clients I work with usually have existing Shopify themes and are looking to launch completely redesigned storefronts. During scoping conversations, I am always very careful to ask about existing systems and apps that the client cannot afford to change in the new theme. Unfortunately, clients often omit crucial details about their existing systems that why would like to keep intact (an app is storing a large amount of custom data or essential tagging systems would be good examples). In these situations, avoiding ""man with a hammer syndrome"" is crucial. Stay adaptable, creative, and prepared to pivot when unexpected challenges arise.

Let‚Äôs GO üìö

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

The evolution of Shopify's customer accounts has been a hot topic in the development community, and for good reason. These new customer accounts might feel unfamiliar at first‚Äîdetached from your Shopify theme, styled by Shopify, and offering only the essentials out of the box. However, after spending significant time working with them, I‚Äôve come to appreciate their flexibility and security.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Shopify has recognized my app, Hubble, as one of the partner apps for this new feature, meaning I‚Äôve had the opportunity to deeply explore their capabilities. If you're a developer or merchant looking to adapt to these changes, here‚Äôs what you need to know.

## The Shift to a Unified Experience

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

With legacy customer accounts, merchants were at the mercy of their theme‚Äôs capabilities. If you were lucky, you had a theme that extended customer accounts beautifully. If not, you either had to settle for its limitations or purchase a new theme altogether.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Now, with the new customer accounts, Shopify levels the playing field. Every merchant, regardless of their theme, gets the same baseline experience. Shopify controls the styling, ensuring consistency across all stores. While this might seem restrictive at first, it actually brings several advantages:

- A Cohesive Look and Feel:Since Shopify handles the design, merchants don‚Äôt have to worry about mismatched styles or clunky integrations.
- Security and Performance:The new customer accounts are built with modern security measures, reducing vulnerabilities that previously existed in custom-built implementations.
- Faster Custom Development:Because Shopify provides built-in components, what used to take a freelancer four days to build might now take just two or three.

## Extending the New Customer Accounts

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Customization is still very much possible, but the approach is different. Instead of modifying your theme, you extend customer accounts usingcustomer account UI extensionsand apps. This means you don‚Äôt have to worry about whether things ""look right""‚ÄîShopify ensures a seamless design.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

For merchants, this is a game-changer. Instead of being locked into a theme‚Äôs capabilities, they can now choose from a growing ecosystem of apps that integrate effortlessly with customer accounts. And for developers, this opens up opportunities to build modular, reusable solutions that work across stores.

### What Can You Do With Custom Apps and UI Extensions?

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

With the right app or developer, you can:

- Add Personalized Content:Display tailored content to customers based on their behavior and purchase history.
- Integrate Loyalty Programs:Offer rewards and incentives directly within the customer portal.
- Enhance Order Management:Provide additional details, upsells, or related actions within the order history.
- Streamline Customer Support:Embed FAQs, support tickets, or live chat integrations.

## Why This Matters

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

The new customer accounts represent a shift in how Shopify merchants engage with their customers. Rather than treating the account page as an afterthought, Shopify is pushing for a standardized yet powerful hub that can be enhanced through apps and extensions.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

This also means that Shopify is making it easier for developers to create and deploy solutions quickly. The more standardized the environment, the faster we can build custom features without reinventing the wheel.

### A Mindset Shift for Freelancers:

- Negotiate Wisely:When discussing pricing, think in terms of the time and value you provide, not just the effort you put in.
- Focus on Outcomes:Clients care more about results than the technical elegance of your code. Frame your work in terms of business impact.
- Optimize for Efficiency:The faster and more effectively you can solve problems, the more valuable you become to clients.

## Final Thoughts

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

The new customer accounts might seem like a significant shift, but they‚Äôre ultimately a step forward for both merchants and developers. By embracing the standardized approach Shopify is pushing, we gain a more secure, scalable, and customizable solution‚Äîone that benefits everyone in the ecosystem.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Whether you‚Äôre a merchant looking to improve customer engagement or a developer building new extensions, now is the time to explore what‚Äôs possible.

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

When working on a Shopify store, one of the biggest decisions developers and merchants face is whether to customize the theme directly or build an app. Both approaches have their place, but choosing the right one can save time, improve maintainability, and optimize store performance.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Having built Shopify apps and worked with countless merchants, I‚Äôve seen both approaches used effectively‚Äîbut also seen them go wrong. So, when should you use theme customization, and when should you build an app? Let‚Äôs dive in.

## When Theme Customization is the Right Choice

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Theme customizations are often the fastest and most lightweight way to implement changes to a Shopify store. If a feature only affects the visual appearance or simple store logic, modifying the theme might be the best approach.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Best scenarios for theme customization:

- You need to adjuststyling or layout(e.g., custom product page design, tweaking cart styles)
- You want to addLiquid logicthat doesn‚Äôt require external data (e.g., showing a message based on cart total)
- The feature should workindependently of apps(e.g., announcement bars or seasonal promos)
- You want the customization to beinstantaneouswithout relying on API calls

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

When theme customization becomes a problem:

- Complex logic requiresexternal databasesordynamic behavior
- You need features thatpersist across theme updates
- The functionality should workacross multiple stores(e.g., reusable for clients)
- You want to avoid breaking changes when merchants switch themes

## When You Should Build an App Instead

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Apps are ideal when you need to add functionality thatgoes beyond what themes can do. Shopify apps allow for advanced logic, better security, and integration with third-party services.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Best scenarios for an app:

- You need tostore data(e.g., customer preferences, loyalty points, subscriptions)
- You requirecustom backend logic(e.g., a price calculator, automatic discounts)
- The feature needs to be usedacross multiple themes(e.g., a reviews widget)
- You wantbetter maintainability(e.g., updates without touching Liquid files)
- The feature requires Shopify‚ÄôsAdmin API, Storefront API, or GraphQL

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Downsides of using an app:

- Can beoverkillfor small changes (e.g., a custom message on a product page doesn‚Äôt need an app)
- Appsrely on external requests, which could introduce latency
- Custom apps requireongoing maintenance, while themes are more ""set it and forget it""

## The Hybrid Approach: Best of Both Worlds?

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

In many cases, the best solution is a mix of both approaches. For example:

- An app couldstore data and provide an API, while a theme modification fetches and displays it
- A UI extension couldinject content dynamically, while the theme handles styling
- Shopify‚Äôsmetaobjects(see my previous article) can allow structured content storagewithoutan external database

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

This balance keeps storesfast, maintainable, and scalable.

## Final Thoughts: What‚Äôs Right for Your Project?

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

If the feature issimple, store-specific, and purely visual‚ÜíTheme customizationis likely the best choice.If the feature requiresdata storage, complex logic, or scalability‚ÜíAn appis the way to go.If you need the best of both worlds, considerhybrid solutionsthat combine both approaches.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

At the end of the day, Shopify is flexible enough to allow both‚Äîso choose what makes sense for your project. üöÄ

He brings a wealth of operational experience having been on in-house teams, at agencies and now freelance.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Let‚Äôs GO üìö

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about:

## When Does Your App Actually Require a Database?

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

If you're building a public Shopify app, having a database is usually a must. You need to store merchant data, track installations, and manage subscriptions if your app has a paid plan. That‚Äôs a given.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

However, some apps‚Äîor even just certain features within an app‚Äîmight not technically require a database at all. This is wheremetaobjectscome in.

### My App as a Case Study

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

In my own app,[Hubble: Target Customers](https://apps.shopify.com/hubble?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-70-your-shopify-app-might-not-need-a-database-heard-of-metaobjects), one of the core features‚ÄîCustomer Account Blocks‚Äîis built aroundmetaobjects. These metaobjects are queried via GraphQL directly in the customer account UI, eliminating the need for redundant database storage.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

That said, we do use a database for certain sensitive or essential data that needs to persist independently of a store‚Äôs installation. After all,metaobjects live within each Shopify storeand are only accessible while your app is installed on that store. So, if you need to store crucial app-level data, a database is still the way to go.

## The Advantages of Using Metaobjects

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Metaobjects provide several key benefits that can make them a viable alternative to traditional databases for some use cases:

### 1. Standard Accessibility Across Shopify Surfaces

- Accessible fromthemes (via Liquid),UI extensions (via GraphQL), andheadless storefronts (via Storefront API).

### 2. Global Distribution for Faster Requests

- Metaobjects are served fromShopify‚Äôs CDN, ensuring that requests are handled by the closest Shopify server.
- This can besignificantly fasterthan fetching data from an app‚Äôs server, especially if your app doesn‚Äôt have global replicas on the edge.

### 3. Cross-App Data Sharing

- Instead of setting upcustom API connectionsbetween apps, we can use metaobjects as a centralized store for shared data. AtOverse, we integrate apps into afleetthat shares data between them.

## ""But Metaobjects Have Limits!""

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Yes, metaobjects do have limits‚Äîcurrently,Shopify limits the number of metaobject definitions and total entries per store. However, these limits are quite generous:

- Basic Shopify Plan: Up to64,000metaobject entries across all definitions.
- Higher Plans: Even more capacity.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

For many use cases, these limitsaren‚Äôt an issue. It really depends on your app‚Äôs requirements.

## The Future: Standard Metaobjects

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Shopify has announcedStandard Metaobjects, which won‚Äôt count toward these limits. Once fully released, these standard definitions will allow apps to storeunlimitedmetaobjects within predefined structures.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

If a standard definition aligns with your use case, you could take advantage of infinite storage without hitting Shopify‚Äôs current limits. We‚Äôll have to wait for the full rollout to see how flexible these will be, but it‚Äôs an exciting development!

## When Should You Use Metaobjects Instead of a Database?

### ‚úÖCustom Apps for a Single Merchant

- If your app is meant forone store only, metaobjects can often handle all the data storage you need.

### ‚úÖPublic Apps with Storefront Features

- If your app has a feature thatrelies on fast, public-facing data access, metaobjects are ideal.
- Since Shopify serves metaobjects via itsCDN, storefront requests will be much faster compared to fetching data from your own server.

It enables deep customization of key store sections to optimize sales‚Äîsomething that fits well with how metaobjects can be leveraged for personalized experiences.

### One learning as a freelancer:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

""When building for merchants, code quality matters‚Äîbut what matters more is delivering high-impact solutions, fast.""

- A dynamic backend and perfectly optimized code are great, but they don‚Äôt drive business results on their own.
- Focus onbuilding what merchants actually need, not what‚Äôs technically impressive.
- Prioritizespeed and real-world impactover over-engineering solutions.

## Final Thoughts

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Metaobjects arenot a complete replacement for databases, but they can be a powerful alternative for specific use cases‚Äîespecially instorefront-heavy appsorsingle-merchant custom apps.

- Optimize for Efficiency:The faster and more effectively you can solve problems, the more valuable you become to clients.

## Final Thoughts

The new customer accounts might seem like a significant shift, but they‚Äôre ultimately a step forward for both merchants and developers. By embracing the standardized approach Shopify is pushing, we gain a more secure, scalable, and customizable solution‚Äîone that benefits everyone in the ecosystem.

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about:GitHub + Shopify - A match made in cyber heaven

## What is GitHub?

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

GitHub is a platform designed for hosting and collaborating on software projects. It offers version control, enabling developers to track and manage changes to their codebase over time.

## Why Use GitHub?

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

GitHub‚Äôs version control is invaluable for developers, allowing them to:

- Track changeswithin the codebase and revert to earlier versions if necessary.
- Collaborate effectivelythrough its branching system, enabling multiple developers to work on different parts of a project simultaneously.
- Ensure quality controlwith workflows that allow project owners or senior developers to review and approve code before deploying it to a live environment.

## Why Use GitHub with Shopify?

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Shopify themes can grow complex as merchants integrate additional functionality into their stores. As these sites scale, and as there is a potential for more developers to contribute to the project, GitHub becomes an essential tool for maintaining order.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Any updates within the Shopify theme, through Shopify, are also updated within GitHub. This means that theme templates, where content can be created for products/pages/articles etc, the JSON data that it creates can also be stored within the GitHub repository, subject to the repositories setup.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

GitHub ensures a streamlined workflow, offering both version control and a reliable system for tracking changes.

## How to Connect Your GitHub Repository to Shopify

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Follow these steps to connect your GitHub repository to Shopify. There are a number of ways to achieve this, however, this is my preferred procedure.:

#### 1. Create a GitHub Account

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

If you don‚Äôt already have an account, sign up at[GitHub](https://github.com/?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-68-github-shopify-a-match-made-in-cyber-heaven).

#### 2. Set Up Your Shopify Theme Repository

- Create ablank repositoryon GitHub.
- Pull the repository to your local machine using GitHub Desktop for simplicity.
- Download/export the latest version of your Shopify theme.
- Place the exported theme files into the folder connected to GitHub Desktop.
- In GitHub Desktop, you‚Äôll see the files appear. Commit the changes and push them to the repository.
- Verify that all files have been pushed by checking the repository on GitHub.

#### 3. Connect GitHub to Shopify

- In Shopify, add a new theme.
- From the dropdown menu, selectConnect from GitHub.
- A drawer will appear showing your GitHub repositories. If your repository isn‚Äôt listed, ensure you‚Äôve granted Shopify the necessary permissions within GitHub.
- Select the branch you want to connect. (You can connect multiple branches, which is ideal for testing or gaining client approval before deploying new functionality.)
- The theme will install in Shopify and can be deployed as the live theme whenever needed.

### Important Notes

- Duplicated themes within Shopify arenot automatically connectedto GitHub, even though they may appear in Shopify‚Äôs theme list.
- GitHub integration ensures a clear workflow for developers and safeguards the theme‚Äôs integrity through consistent version control.

### One learning as a freelancer:

# I Ain‚Äôt Afraid of No Ghosts

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

The vibes from the last meeting seemed promising. The email you sent afterward was encouraging, meticulously laid out, and practically a grammar enthusiast‚Äôs dream. You‚Äôd know, you spent ages crafting it. And then‚Ä¶ nothing.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Anxiety creeps in. You reread the email, scrutinising every line, worrying it might come across as pretentious or that you mistakenly wroteeffectinstead ofaffect.Grammarly gives you the green light, and your partner assures you there‚Äôs nothing wrong. You wait a couple more days, then send a polite follow-up.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Despite your best efforts, your positive mindset and your best laid out plans, you are greeted with deafening silence!

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Being ghosted is a horrible feeling, one that most, if not all, of us experience at some point in our careers. It‚Äôs incredibly hard not to take it personally. But here‚Äôs the thing: nine times out of ten, it‚Äôs not about you.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

More often than not, the person on the other end doesn‚Äôt know how to articulate their decision or disappointment. Maybe they want to avoid confrontation, don‚Äôt know how to phrase things respectfully, or are simply too busy to respond.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

While feedback is always valuable, perhaps the silence can be a blessing and it allows us, as freelancers, to dodge a proverbial bullet. Perhaps it will allow us to work with clients who truly respect our time and effort.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Sometimes, external factors can also come into play. With the recent traumatic events in Los Angeles, it made me realise that responding to freelancers, during that horrific time, isn‚Äôt always that high on peoples priority list. It‚Äôs a reminder that the person on the other end of those emails or meetings is human too, dealing with their own various struggles.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

If (or rather, when) you find yourself being ghosted, here are a few ways to support yourself:

- Acknowledge your feelings.It‚Äôs okay to feel disappointed.
- Don‚Äôt be too hard on yourself.As mentioned, it‚Äôs probably not about you.
- Surround yourself with people who respect you.Their encouragement can be grounding.
- Step away and recharge.Sometimes, a walk in nature is all it takes to reset your mindset.
- Seek professional support if needed.If the feelings become overwhelming, don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out for help.

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about:The Versatility Of Block Types

## What is a block type?

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Blocks arecustomisable moduleswithin sections that allow you to add different types of content to enrich and enhance a template.

## Why should I use block types?

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

A well-designed and carefully constructed template enables users to create and update their store‚Äôs layouts independently, reducing the need for ongoing developer support. One of the standout features of Shopify 2.0 is the ability to create variousblock typeswithin a specific section, allowing for unparalleled flexibility and customisation in the template design.

## Planning and Building a Shopify Section

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Before starting the build of a section, it‚Äôs important to plan the types of blocks you‚Äôll need and consider whether any limitations should be applied to them.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

For example, on aProduct Page, themes often use theAdd to Cartbutton as a block type, allowing it to be positioned at various points on the page. However, for both user experience and technical reasons, only oneAdd to Cartbutton is required. Therefore, limiting this block type to a single instance in the template is essential.

### Defining Blocks with Section Schema

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Thesection schemadetermines the block types and the options assigned to them. To create a basic schema with three different block types, you can use the following example:

`{% schema %}
{
 ""name"": ""Custom Block"",
 ""blocks"": [
   {
     ""type"": ""image"",
     ""name"": ""Images"",
     ""settings"": [
     ]
   },
   {
       ""type"": ""content"",
       ""name"": ""Content"",
       ""settings"": [
       ]
   },
   {
       ""type"": ""quote"",
       ""name"": ""Quote"",
       ""settings"": [
       ]
   }
 ],
 ""settings"": [
 ],
 ""presets"": [
   {
     ""name"": ""Custom Block"",
     ""settings"": {}
   }
 ]
}
{% endschema %}`

## Configuring Block Types in Shopify Sections

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Although these blocks may not have any settings attached to them, they will still be usable within the template and can be attached when the section is activated.

- Type Value:Thetypevalue serves as the unique identifier for the block and is required. While you can define various block types, it‚Äôs advisable to keep the options streamlined to avoid user confusion. Providing too many different block types can make the interface less intuitive.
- Setting Limits:Adding a limit ensures that only a specified number of a particular block type can be used within the section. This is particularly helpful for maintaining consistency and preventing errors‚Äîsuch as limiting the number of an ""Add to Cart"" button block to one for technical and usability reasons.

`{
       ""type"": ""content"",
       ""name"": ""Content"",
	""limit"": 1,
       ""settings"": [
       ]
   },`

### Rendering Blocks with Liquid

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Once the schema is set up, you can useLiquidto loop through the blocks in your section. This ensures that each block is dynamically rendered and visible on the page.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Here‚Äôs an example of how to loop through blocks within a section:

`{%- for block in section.blocks -%}<div>{{ block.id }}</div>{%- endfor -%}`

### Customising Block Display with a Switch Statement

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

The initial loop will render all the block IDs and settings, but if each block needs a unique appearance or functionality based on its type, aswitch statementis required. This ensures that content is dynamically tailored to the specific block type.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

When blocks share settings with the same names, they might render similarly. However, if the goal is to display distinct content for each block type, a more granular approach is needed. Theblock.typevalue can be used to differentiate the rendering logic for each block.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Here‚Äôs an example implementation:

`{%- for block in section.blocks -%}
{%- case block.type -%}
 	{%- when ""image"" -%}<div>This is an image block</div>{%- when ""content"" -%}<div>This is a content block</div>{%- when ""quote"" -%}<div>This is a quote block</div>{% endcase %}
 {%- endfor -%}`

## Flexible Block Rendering with Liquid

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

With this simple setup, each block will dynamically appear on the screen, displaying unique information based on the selected block type.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

This is a foundational example, but the potential to expand is immense. By incorporatingvariablesandLiquid filters, you can create more complex and customisable blocks to suit a wide range of design and functionality requirements.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

The possibilities are substantial, allowing developers to build out rich, dynamic templates that cater to unique business needs while maintaining flexibility and ease of use for end-users.

### One learning as a freelancer:

# Work or Life? Why not both?

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Achieving the right work-life balance may seem like a clich√© in the freelance world, but it‚Äôs undeniably essential for becoming a more efficient and fulfilled freelancer.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Whether you ‚Äúwork to live‚Äù or ‚Äúlive to work,‚Äù finding that equilibrium leads to a more rewarding life. Overworking can have negative consequences‚Äînot only for you but for those around you. It can also mean missing out on life‚Äôs irreplaceable moments. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs crucial to prioritize what truly matters.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Freelancing is both a stressful and exhilarating career path. While being your own boss has its perks, keeping clients happy and maintaining a steady income often requires a daily juggling act. Personally, I prioritize playing football (soccer) 2-4 times a week‚Äînot just for physical fitness but as a way to completely disconnect for an hour or two, recharge, and return to work with a fresh perspective. Though I‚Äôm still working toward my ideal balance, I‚Äôve learned that taking time to ‚Äúdown tools‚Äù is essential to finishing tasks effectively.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

What works for me may not work for you, but whether it‚Äôs sports, mindfulness, family time, or any activity that helps you recharge, it‚Äôs vital to set boundaries and make time for it. Scheduling these moments into your busy lifestyle ensures you‚Äôre taking care of both your personal well-being and your professional success.

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about:Liquid vs Hydrogen - Which framework for the next Shopify build

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Before diving in, I want to clarify that while I‚Äôm not a Hydrogen expert, I do have a solid understanding of React and have previously explored Hydrogen builds. For a more comprehensive perspective, I recommend consulting a specialist in Hydrogen development.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

One of the key decisions when building a Shopify store is choosing between aLiquid Buildor aHydrogen Headless Build. This decision requires careful consideration to ensure the best outcome for the final product.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Here are some important factors to consider before starting the build process:

## What is Liquid?

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Liquid, Shopify‚Äôs traditional templating language based on Ruby, has been the cornerstone of Shopify themes for years. All Shopify themes are built using Liquid.

## What is Hydrogen?

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Hydrogen is a modern, React-based framework for building custom, headless frontends for Shopify stores. It typically interacts with Shopify via the GraphQL or REST APIs, offering more flexibility for developers.

## Which Option Should You Choose?

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

When deciding between Liquid and Hydrogen, it‚Äôs essential to weigh the pros and cons of each option. Here are some factors to consider:

#### 1. Customisation

- Liquid: Provides a robust level of customisation within its framework but comes with inherent limitations, such as restrictions on the checkout page.
- Hydrogen: Offers virtually unlimited flexibility, enabling highly customised frontends that can retrieve and send data to Shopify without being confined by a templating structure.

#### 2. Performance

- Hydrogen builds, when optimised, can deliver faster performance and access data more efficiently through the GraphQL API compared to Liquid builds.

#### 3. Content Management (CMS)

- Liquid: Shopify 2.0‚Äôs theme customizer has significantly improved its CMS capabilities, making it more scalable within its ecosystem.
- Hydrogen: Often requires an external CMS (likeSanity.io) to enable clients to create and update pages effectively.

#### 4. Infrastructure, Support & Maintenance

- Liquid: Shopify fully supports the infrastructure, including security and maintenance, offering peace of mind.
- Hydrogen: Requires ongoing developer involvement to maintain, secure, and update the site manually.

#### 5. Apps and Integration

- Liquid: Shopify‚Äôs app library provides an extensive range of tools to meet store requirements.
- Hydrogen: Not all Shopify apps offer APIs for Hydrogen, meaning developers may need to create custom solutions. While this adds flexibility, it also increases complexity.

## Cost vs. Customisation

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Ultimately, the choice often comes down to balancingcostandcustomisation:

- Liquid: Faster and more cost-effective to implement, with lower maintenance requirements.
- Hydrogen: Requires more time, resources, and expertise but eliminates most limitations, enabling unique and highly interactive designs.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

As there is a potential that user expectations shift toward an app-like experience, Hydrogen‚Äôs flexibility positions it as a strong contender for future-forward Shopify stores.

## Final Thoughts

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

There‚Äôs no definitive ‚Äúright‚Äù answer. Instead, the best choice depends on your client‚Äôs specific needs and long-term goals. While a Liquid build may seem simpler initially, it‚Äôs important to consider whether it could limit growth in the future. Evaluating these factors upfront will ensure the chosen approach aligns with the client‚Äôs vision and scalability needs.

## Knowing Your Worth: How to Charge Correctly

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

The questions‚ÄúHow much should I charge?‚Äùand‚ÄúHow much am I worth?‚Äùoften feel distinct, but in reality, they‚Äôre deeply intertwined.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

It‚Äôs tempting to lower your rates to secure a project, especially when there‚Äôs pressure to get sign-off on funding. However, in my experience, projects where prices are dramatically reduced often end up costing more‚Äîboth in time and effort‚Äîthan those charged at standard rates.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Consider this: You wouldn‚Äôt expect to buy a top-of-the-line sports convertible with all the bells and whistles for the price of a second-hand car equipped with a cassette player playing ‚ÄòNever Gonna Give You Up‚Äô on repeat (yes, I‚Äôm showing my age here!). So why should it be any different when hiring a skilled digital professional?

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Your knowledge, experience, and quality of work are the result of years of dedication‚Äîcountless hours, challenges, and investments in learning and growth. These are not easily replicated, even with the rise of AI. Your interactions with clients are unique, and your expertise is invaluable. Respect yourself by valuing your time, and valuing your time means charging appropriately.

### Key Considerations When Setting Your Rates

- Research the MarketUnderstand what others with similar skills and expertise are charging. Use this as a baseline to establish your rates.
- Account for Your ExpensesRemember, profitability matters‚Äîeven if your primary focus is building experience, creating unique experiences, or enhancing relationships. Ensure your rates cover your expenses and leave room for growth.
- Value Your TimePlan your project timelines carefully and factor in buffer time. Projects are rarely approved without revisions or delays, so give yourself the flexibility to adapt.
- Assess the ClientDoes the client respect your expertise and communicate professionally?Are they persistently pushing for discounts or dangling promises of future work in exchange for reduced rates?These can be red flags. A good client values your skills and is willing to pay for them.

### Final Thoughts

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Everyone‚Äôs rates are different, and there‚Äôs no universal formula. The key is to understand your skills, experience, and the value you bring to the table‚Äîand charge accordingly. When you set your rates properly, you‚Äôre more likely to attract the right clients: those who respect your work, value your expertise, and make your freelancing journey rewarding.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

First edit of 4, let‚Äôs goooo!

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about:‚ÄúWhat I love (and hate) about the AJAX API‚Äù

## What is the AJAX API

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Shopify‚Äôs AJAX API is a lightweight REST API that provides a quick and efficient way to add useful functionality to a theme without needing to install an app or set up authentication for the REST or GraphQL APIs.

## What can the API be used for

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

The AJAX API‚Äôs primary strength lies in its ability to interact with the cart. For example, it enables front-end interactivity on a Shopify store, allowing users to add, update, or remove products from the cart‚Äîfunctionality that can be implemented anywhere on the site.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Additionally, the API can be used to retrieve product data, generate product recommendations, or power predictive search. With its versatility, the AJAX API offers an easy way to implement advanced functionality that enhances the theme and elevates the user experience.

## How to use it

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Even though it's called the AJAX API, using jQuery is not a requirement. Native JavaScript is a great alternative for leveraging its functionality.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

For instance, retrieving product information requires only the product handle, enabling you to gather various data about a product without reloading the page. Here's a simple example:

`fetch(window.Shopify.routes.root + 'products/red-rain-coat.js')
.then(response => response.json())
.then(product => console.log('The title of this product is ' + product.title));`
p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

This example fetches the product data and logs the product's title to the JavaScript console. By tweaking the code, you can display other product details. For example, the following snippet retrieves the product ID and formats the price in US dollars:

`let USDollar = new Intl.NumberFormat('en-US', {
style: 'currency',
currency: 'USD',
});

fetch(window.Shopify.routes.root + 'products/red-rain-coat.js')
.then(response => response.json())
.then(product => console.log(product.id + ' ' + USDollar.format(product.price)));`
p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

These examples demonstrate how flexible the AJAX API is for integrating product data into your Shopify theme. For more detailed guidance, visit the official documentation:[Shopify AJAX API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/ajax?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-65-what-i-love-and-hate-about-the-ajax-api).

## What I love about the AJAX API

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

As mentioned earlier, the AJAX API allows you to add items to the cart or retrieve product data from anywhere on the website through front-end interactions. This is particularly useful for implementing features like bundle builders or selecting multiple options before finalizing a product variant.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

The setup for the AJAX API is lightweight and does not require authentication, making it quick to implement. However, this simplicity comes with a trade-off in terms of security, which may be a concern in some cases.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Another powerful feature of the AJAX API is its integration with the Section Rendering API. This enables you to rebuild specific sections of a page dynamically using JavaScript or jQuery, based on front-end interactions, without requiring a full-page reload.

## What I dislike about the AJAX API

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

The AJAX API is a versatile tool but does come with limitations. While it enables excellent use cases, such as building bundle builders, its scope is restricted by the data it can access. For more complex applications that require access to a wider range of store data, you‚Äôll likely need to use Shopify‚Äôs REST or GraphQL APIs.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

One key aspect to consider is that no authentication is required to set up the AJAX API. While this simplifies implementation, it also poses potential security risks, so caution is advised when using it.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Another notable limitation is the restriction on the number of product variants that can be retrieved at once, which could affect certain use cases.

## Summary

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I love using the AJAX API for setting up bundle builders or variant choosers. However, it's crucial to establish client requirements upfront before committing to its use. There's nothing more frustrating than investing time into building a solution, only for the client to later request features‚Äîlike adjusting customer details as part of the bundle builder‚Äîthat the AJAX API cannot access.

## Dealing with Imposter Syndrome

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Imposter Syndromeis the feeling that you‚Äôre not capable of or don‚Äôt deserve the success or praise for your achievements, accompanied by a persistent fear that your lack of abilities will be ‚Äúfound out.‚Äù

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

This common struggle affects many professionals and can lead to unnecessary anxiety or even depression. British comedianTroy Hawkesummed it up humorously:‚ÄúDo you know who does not get imposter syndrome? Imposters. An imposter with imposter syndrome is simply self-aware.‚Äù

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

For freelancers, imposter syndrome can significantly hinder progress. I personally find myself questioning whether I‚Äôm truly capable of handling projects I‚Äôm fully qualified for, often missing out on opportunities as a result.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

But can imposter syndrome be overcome? Absolutely. By shifting your mindset and adopting healthier practices, you can remind yourself that you are more than capable of handling the roles you‚Äôre pursuing.

### Steps to Overcome Imposter Syndrome

- Acknowledge Your FeelingsRecognize when you‚Äôre experiencing imposter syndrome and remind yourself that it‚Äôs a common feeling among high achievers.
- Challenge Negative Self-TalkReplace self-doubt with constructive thoughts. Focus on your strengths and achievements instead of perceived shortcomings.
- Practice Self-CompassionTreat yourself with kindness. Perfection isn‚Äôt a requirement for success.
- Share Your ExperiencesTalk to others about how you‚Äôre feeling. You‚Äôll often find that you‚Äôre not alone, and shared experiences can be comforting.
- Seek SupportSurround yourself with mentors, colleagues, or friends who can validate your abilities and provide encouragement.
- Accept Positive FeedbackLearn to accept compliments and praise without downplaying your efforts.
- Take Steps to Overcome PerfectionismStrive for progress, not perfection. Celebrate small wins along the way.
- Reassess Your Perceived GapsIdentify the skills or knowledge you feel you lack, and take proactive steps to bridge those gaps.

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about:a11y - e-commerce for everyone

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Recently I was fortunate to have a in-depth session with a web accessibility expert. I‚Äôd always though my ""add some ARIA labels and call it a day"" approach was enough, but I was introduced to genuine, thoughtful accessibility that makes online shopping possible for everyone.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Here's a sobering thought: about 1 in 5 customers could have some form of disability. It's not just about compliance or doing the right thing (though those are important!) ‚Äì it's also about business impact, there‚Äôs potentially a tonne of money being left on the table. Imagine having a physical store where 20% of customers couldn't get through the door. We'd fix that immediately, right? Yet in e-commerce, we often overlook these digital barriers.

### Smart Keyboard Navigation

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

‚Äã‚ÄãIt's crucial to go beyond default tab behavior. Things like product cards should have clear focus states (using visual indicators like rings or outlines), a logical tab order that matches the visual layout, and proper screen reader support. Simple touches like adding ""Price:"" labels for screen readers and ensuring all product images have meaningful alt text make a huge difference. Using tabindex=""0"" makes sure interactive elements are properly accessible, while proper CSS classes for focus states (like focus rings) provide clear visual feedback for keyboard users.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Key points:

- Clear focus states that work with both mouse and keyboard
- Logical tab order that follows visual layout
- Screen reader announcements for important information
- No keyboard traps in modals or dropdowns

### Thoughtful Colour Contrast

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Check your colour scheme [https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/](https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-64-a11y-e-commerce-for-everyone) will generate a matrix with your colour scheme that will tell you what passes, is suitable for large text only, or does not pass. You might be surprised by the results.

### Clear Error States

`<divclass=""form-group""role=""group""aria-labelledby=""size-label""><labelid=""size-label""for=""size-select"">Select Size</label><selectid=""size-select""name=""size""aria-invalid=""{% if size_error %}true{% else %}false{% endif %}""aria-describedby=""{% if size_error %}size-error{% endif %}""><!-- options --></select>{% if size_error %}<divid=""size-error""class=""error-message""role=""alert"">Please select a size before adding to cart</div>{% endif %}</div>`
p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Always test with a screen reader after implementing. The code for this form looks good, but when submitted with an error, a screen reader will repeat the error twice due to the unnecessary aria-describedby attribute.

### Quick Wins You Can Implement Today

`<ahref=""#main-content""class=""skip-link sr-only focus:not-sr-only"">Skip to main content</a>`
p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Proper Headings: Maintain a logical heading structure (h1 ‚Üí h2 ‚Üí h3)

`<h1>{{ collection.title }}</h1><divclass=""product-grid"">{% for product in collection.products %}<h2class=""text-lg"">{{ product.title }}</h2>{% endfor %}</div>`
p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Default alt text:We can‚Äôt always trust there will be alt text set, so use a sensible default

`{% assign alt_text = product.featured_image.alt | default: product.title | escape %}<img‚Ä¶alt=""{{ alt_text }}""/>`
p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Meaningful Button/Link Text: No more ‚ÄúClick Here‚Äù

`<!-- Instead of --><button>Click Here</button><!-- Use --><button>Add {{ product.title }} to Cart<spanclass=""sr-only"">{{ money_price }}</span></button>`

### Testing Makes Perfect

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I've started using these tools in my development workflow:

- WAVE browser extension for quick audits
- Keyboard navigation testing (try using your store without a mouse!)
- Screen reader testing (VoiceOver on Mac, NVDA on Windows)
- Lighthouse accessibility scores as part of CI/CD or via a monitoring tool

### Beyond the Basics

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Some advanced practices I'm implementing:

- Reduced motion preferences for animations
- High contrast mode support
- Focus management in dynamic content
- ARIA live regions for cart updates

### The Business Case

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Proper accessibility has proven to:

- Increase mobile conversion rates
- Reduce cart abandonment
- Improve SEO performance
- Reduce support tickets

I‚Äôve found this app super useful when needing to make bulk changes to store data. I‚Äôve used it to set metafields based on product type, update price comparison data using a formula and standardise SKUs among other things. Being able to export the data, manipulate it with a script, and then re-upload it makes these kinds of operations on large product sets really painless, and the built-in backup has saved me on a more than one occasion.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Following with the accessibility theme, I‚Äôm highlighting Accessibility Spark this week. While there are many accessibility testing tools available, this Shopify app has a practical approach to making stores WCAG compliant. Beyond just flagging issues, it provides actionable fixes with code snippets ‚Äì a huge time-saver.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

What sets it apart is how well it fits into a development workflow: real-time monitoring catches issues before they hit production, automated fixes handle common problems (like missing ARIA labels and colour contrast issues), and detailed reports help communicate accessibility improvements to clients. The time saved on manual testing alone makes it worth the investment.

## One learning as a freelancer: The Art of Saying No

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I had to say a difficult no this week. There was an exciting project on the table, the clients seemed great, but I just didn‚Äôt have the capacity to commit to the project. As freelancers, we often start with a scarcity mindset. Every project feels like it could be our last, every client feels irreplaceable, and saying ‚Äúno‚Äù feels like career suicide. But saying ‚Äúyes‚Äù to everything can come at a great cost. You end up doing things you never wanted to do in the first place, which can lead to resentment, burnout and ultimately worsen your relationships far more than saying ‚Äúno‚Äù would have. You can‚Äôt just scream ‚ÄúNOOOO‚Äù at everything you don‚Äôt want to do though, saying ‚Äúno‚Äù is a skill that must be developed.

### When to Say No

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

There are a few key questions you can ask to help

- Will this project help me grow in the direction I want?
- Does the budget reflect the value I provide?
- Do I have the time to deliver excellence?
- Is this client someone I want to work with long-term?

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Derek Sivers has a great concept of ‚ÄúHell yeah or no‚Äù. There‚Äôll usually be a gut feeling, and if saying ‚Äúyes‚Äù causes any feelings of dread, stress, anxiety, listen to that and decline. Never settle for a ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù. Maybe is just a no you‚Äôre too scared to say out loud.

### How to say No

- Keep responses firm but gentle - ""I'm afraid I can't"" rather than a blunt ""no""
- Distinguish between non-negotiable (""hard no"") and circumstantial (""soft no"") refusals
- Don't over-explain - avoid the JADE trap (Justify, Argue, Defend, Explain)
- Use clear but considerate phrases like:‚ÄúWith my current workload, I can't start this until [date]‚Äù‚ÄúI'm not taking on new clients currently, but I'll reach out when I have some capacity‚Äù‚ÄúThis timeline wouldn't allow me to deliver the quality you deserve‚Äù
- Maintain positive body language and professionalism when delivering in person

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Learning when and how to say no can be really difficult, but it is a wonderful act of self-care. Develop this skill to regain time, energy and peace of mind.

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about:Theme Settings New Superpower

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

In a previous edition I talked about how much I love metaobjects, and now we've got two new powerful tools in the theme development toolkit:metaobjectandmetaobject_listsettings. I've been experimenting with these, and I'm excited about the possibilities they open up. These new settings act as a bridge between a theme's customization options and the structured data from metaobjects, which can now be directly selected from the theme editor.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

A practical example for implementing re-usable FAQ content. Let's say we have an FAQ metaobject with a question and answer field. Now you can create a flexible section that uses this:

`{% schema %}
{
  ""name"": ""FAQ Block"",
  ""settings"": [
    {
      ""type"": ""text"",
      ""id"": ""title"",
      ""label"": ""Section Title"",
      ""default"": ""Frequently Asked Questions""
    },
    {
      ""type"": ""metaobject_list"",
      ""id"": ""faq_entries"",
      ""label"": ""FAQ Entries"",
      ""metaobject_type"": ""shopify--faq""
    }
  ],
  ...
}
{% endschema %}<divclass=""faq-section""><h2>{{ section.settings.title }}</h2><divclass=""faq-container"">{% for faq in section.settings.faq_entries %}<divclass=""faq-item""><divclass=""faq-question"">{{ faq.question }}</div><div>{{ faq.answer }}</div></div>{% endfor %}</div></div>`
p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Now merchants can:

- Create FAQ content once, use it everywhere
- Maintain consistent answers across all pages
- Update shipping or return policy answers in one place
- Easily translate FAQ content for multiple languages

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

What excites me most is how these settings democratize content management. Instead of building complex custom solutions or requiring merchants to remember specific metafield handles, we can now provide intuitive picker interfaces right in the theme editor.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Some potential use cases I'm thinking about:

- Size guide content blocks
- Shipping policy sections
- Product care instructions
- Cross-sellable content blocks
- Promotional banner content

I‚Äôve found this app super useful when needing to make bulk changes to store data. I‚Äôve used it to set metafields based on product type, update price comparison data using a formula and standardise SKUs among other things. Being able to export the data, manipulate it with a script, and then re-upload it makes these kinds of operations on large product sets really painless, and the built-in backup has saved me on a more than one occasion.

Outcomes over output.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

It sounds a bit counter intuitive as a software developer, but very few clients have paid me for code. It‚Äôs easy to get caught up in the craft and obsess over elegant solutions and, while that does matter, it's merely a means to an end, not the end itself. What they want are business outcomes.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Start with ""Why?""

- Before writing any code, understand what success looks like for the business
- Ask about specific metrics they want to improve
- Discuss how they'll measure the impact

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Speak Their Language

- Instead of talking about technical implementations, try to focus on the business impact
- ‚ÄúImplement fuzzy search and natural language processing to improve results‚Äù vs ""Customers will find exactly what they're looking for on their first search""
- ""Implement an AI driven product recommendation engine"" vs ""Increase average order value as customers find complementary products""

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Validate Early and Often

- Check if your solution is actually solving the business problem
- Get feedback on outcomes, not just functionality
- Be willing to pivot if the solution isn't achieving the desired results

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

When you focus on business outcomes, clients will trust your technical decisions more. They see you as a partner in achieving their goals, not just a coder implementing features. Plus, when you need to advocate for technical improvements, you can frame them in terms of business outcomes. Now when starting new projects, I try to lead with ""What business outcome are we trying to achieve?"" instead of ""What do you want me to build?""

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about:Alpine.js - The Secret Sauce for Interactivity

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Alpine.js is the sweet spot between simplicity and functionality. It has become increasingly popular in the Laravel community for the ability to easily sprinkle interactivity onto the server-side rendered templates, and this translates perfectly to Shopify themes.

### Why Alpine.js is Perfect for Shopify Themes

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Let me share why I'm increasingly reaching for Alpine.js instead of heavier alternatives:

- Zero Build Process: Unlike Vue or React, you can drop Alpine.js directly into your theme with a single script tag. No build steps, no webpack configuration, no package.json to maintain. Just pure, simple functionality.

`<scriptdefersrc=""//unpkg.com/alpinejs""></script>`
- Familiar Syntax: If you've ever worked with Vue.js, you'll feel right at home. The declarative syntax is intuitive and plays nicely with Liquid:

`<divx-data=""{ isOpen: false }""><button@click=""isOpen = !isOpen"">{% render 'icon-toggle' %}
		{{ section.settings.toggle_text }}</button><divx-show=""isOpen""x-transition>{{ section.settings.content }}</div></div>`
- Progressive Enhancement: Alpine.js respects the web's progressive enhancement philosophy. Your theme remains functional even if JavaScript fails to load ‚Äì something that's particularly important in e-commerce.

### Real-World Example: Quick View Modal

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

This example demonstrates how easy it is to implement a product Quickview modal using Alpine.js

`<divx-data=""{ 
  quickView: false, 
  productTitle: '', 
  productPrice: '', 
  variantId: null 
}"">{% for product in collection.products %}<button@click=""
        quickView = true;
        productTitle = '{{ product.title | escape }}';
        productPrice = '{{ product.price | money }}';
        variantId = '{{ product.selected_variant.id }}'
      "">Quick View</button>{% endfor %}<divx-show=""quickView""@click.away=""quickView = false""x-transition.opacity><h2x-text=""productTitle""></h2><px-text=""productPrice""></p><button@click=""
        addItemsToCart({ items: [{ id: variantId, quantity: 1 }] });
        quickView = false;
      "">Add to Cart</button></div></div>`
p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

It's all declarative, stays within your theme's context, and requires minimal JavaScript knowledge to maintain.

### Beyond Basic Interactivity

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I've found Alpine.js particularly useful for:

- Complex dropdown navigation menus
- Cart drawer functionality
- Product option selectors
- Infinite scroll implementations
- Local search filtering

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

The framework's small size (‚âà10kb gzipped) means you can add these features without significantly impacting load times.

### The Learning Curve

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

The learning curve is gentle. If you can write HTML and understand basic JavaScript, you can be productive with Alpine.js in hours.

- Just JavaScript- I wish this existed when I was new to JavaScript, and would recommend it to anyone starting out, but equally to experienced developers.

The developer experience is unmatched - clean APIs, solid documentation, and their InstantSearch.js library means you can have AI-powered search running in minutes. Clients that are into data will love the analytics dashboard, and if you want to take it further, the search personalisation and recommendation widgets are super powerful.

### One learning as a freelancer:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Time blocking: The only productivity ‚Äúhack‚Äù that has had a lasting impact - and I‚Äôve tried just about everything.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

One of the biggest difficulties I found freelancing is managing my schedule. Juggling multiple clients, deadlines, keeping up with communications, the ‚Äúemergencies‚Äù that all seem to happen at the same time. Most freelancers I‚Äôve talked to can relate to this, and it can easily turn toxic with overwhelming to-do lists, long hours, and feelings of guilt and anxiety any time you put the laptop down - a fast track to burnout. Time blocking has completely transformed how I work and has had a surprising positive effect on my personal life and relationships too. I‚Äôve moved from a place of constantly feeling reactive, to feeling (mostly) in control of my time and schedule.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

The concept is simple: pre-decide how you'll spend every hour of your day. Think of it like budgeting for your time. The obvious blocks are for coding work, scoping/quoting new projects, client meetings and communication, but now I also block the time I spend with my family, exercising, and even have scheduled doom scrolling and TV binge time - everything gets a dedicated block. The rule I follow is I can move blocks in the future as much as I want, but today‚Äôs blocks are immutable (outside of emergencies, of course).

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Combined with my focused work approach:

- All notifications off during deep work (except true emergencies)
- The 10-minute rule for distractions (wait before acting)
- Protected coding blocks (uninterrupted focus time)
- Batched communications (no random context switching)

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

The result has been better quality ‚Äúdeeper‚Äù work, feeling more in control of my time and projects and guilt-free scheduled downtime that keeps the burnout at bay. Turns out the best productivity hack, for me at least, isn't a new tool or app, it's simply protecting my time.

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about: Metaobjects are underrated

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

First, let me sing the praises of Shopify Metaobjects. They're one of the most useful recent additions to the Shopify ecosystem, and they're quickly becoming my secret weapon for developing cost-effective, flexible, custom solutions.

### A Real-World Problem

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

A client came to me with a seemingly simple request: implement free gifts when the cart value reaches certain thresholds. Sounds straightforward, right? But here's the twist ‚Äì they wanted multiple tiers (spend $100 get X, spend $200 get Y, and so on).

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Shopify's built-in automatic discounts system wasn't up to the task. We reviewed what was availble in the App Store, but existing solutions all fell short for various reasons. It was time to get creative.

### The ""Micro App"" Solution

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

This is where the magic of Metaobjects and Serverless functions comes into play. Here's how we crafted our solution:

- We created a new Metaobject definition to store the gift tiers. Simple and elegant ‚Äì just three fields: Threshold Amount, Gift Product, and Tier Label.
- On application load, we query the gift tier Metaobjects using the Storefront API.
- After fetching the metaobjects, we use the cart total to calculate the current tier, next achievable tier, and remaining amount needed. In this case, it was a headless store built with React, so the tiers and calculated values were stored in shared state, and had an action to update whenever the cart was updated.
- We then added components to the cart page showcasing the current free gift (if applicable) and a progress bar indicating the spend remaining to achieve the next free gift tier. This was coupled with a ""You may also like"" section containing related products that were priced just above the remaining spend, which turned out to be a powerful combination for increasing average order value.
- When a customer selects the free gift, we set a metafield on the cart containing the chosen variant.
- When the customer proceeds to checkout, we hijack the checkout button and send a request to a serverless function. The function creates a draft order via the Admin API, adds the free gift (with 100% discount) alongside the other cart items, and redirects the customer to the returned ‚Äúinvoice URL‚Äù for a smooth checkout experience.

### The Power of Micro Apps

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

What excites me most is how this approach opens up a world of possibilities. I've used similar techniques for a custom product bundles app, applying member ‚Äúclub‚Äù pricing discounts, creating custom product variants on-the-fly (e.g products with customisable dimensions) among many other customisations.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

In the past, these features would have required extensive development or pricey recurring app subscriptions (often involving trade-offs in functionality). Now, with the Metaobjects + Serverless functions combo, we can create these ""micro apps"" that do exactly what the client wants, efficiently and cost-effectively - I was able to put this particular one together in a couple of hours.

Having a regular and automated backup system is crucial for any software, but especially when it comes to e-commerce where mistakes can be extremely costly. Rewind backups allows you to restore images, descriptions, blogs, themes, orders, pages and more at the click of a button. Think of it like insurance. Ideally, you will never need to use it, but if/when you do, it could save your life.

### One learning as a freelancer:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Communication is key. Your technical skills are only half the battle. If your technical skills are at a 10/10, but your ability to communicate is a 3/10, how will your clients perceive you?

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

The hard truth is, no matter how elegant your code is, if you can't effectively communicate with your clients, your overall value takes a massive hit.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Here's why communication is so critical:

- It builds trust: Clear, consistent communication shows professionalism and reliability.
- It manages expectations: Properly explaining processes, timelines, and potential issues prevents misunderstandings.
- It showcases your value: Articulating the 'why' behind your decisions helps clients appreciate your expertise.
- It leads to better outcomes: Good communication often results in more precise project requirements and smoother collaborations.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Remember, to your client, you're not just a coder ‚Äì you're a problem solver and a partner. Strive to be as strong in your communication skills as you are in your technical abilities. It's an investment that will pay dividends in client satisfaction, project success, and your professional growth.

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

As developer, you‚Äôve probably run into the same issue I have: app overload. Shopify apps are great for adding functionality, but after a certain point, you start noticing the drag on load times. When you‚Äôre working on a store with 20 or 30 apps, each loading their own JS and CSS files, the performance hits can be hard to ignore.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

The thing is, many of these apps are solving simple problems‚Äîones we could handle directly in the theme if we just rolled up our sleeves. In my experience, reducing reliance on apps not only boosts performance but also gives you more control over the codebase. By taking the time to build custom features into the theme using Liquid, JavaScript, or API integrations, you can create a solution tailored to the store‚Äôs needs without the bloat that comes with multiple third-party tools.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

One strategy I‚Äôve started using is leveraging Shopify‚Äôs built-in capabilities likeMetafields. You can store additional data for products, pages, or collections and display it without needing an app to manage things like custom product information or enhanced functionality.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

The bottom line is, apps are great for adding quick features, but if you‚Äôre serious about performance, it‚Äôs worth considering where you can replace them with custom-built solutions. You maintain full control, the code is easier to manage, and the store stays fast.

Hey everyone!

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Welcome to my 3rd contribution to the¬† [i_only_speak_liquid](https://ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com/) newsletter!

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I'm [Martynas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martynasmarcenko/?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-59-elevating-shopify-themes-with-custom-sections), a freelance web developer and proud member of the [Storetasker](https://resources.storetasker.com/become-an-expert?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-49-all-about-fonts) network. I spend a lot of time building Shopify sites, and also React applications.

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

As developer, you know how limiting it can feel when a theme only comes with a few predefined sections. You‚Äôve probably experienced a client asking for custom features like video testimonials, sliders, or social proof elements‚Äîthings not easily handled by default Shopify themes.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

That‚Äôs where I‚Äôve foundDesign Packs. Instead of rewriting a bunch of custom Liquid code or hacking existing sections, you can drop in pre-built sections that seamlessly blend into any theme. Whether it‚Äôs a simple banner with a video background or a fully custom landing page, these tools expand your capabilities without all the extra dev time. And the best part? It‚Äôs integrated directly into the theme‚Äôs Liquid code‚Äîno extra apps bogging down performance.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

From a development perspective, it also gives you control. You can tweak the sections as much as you like, maintaining the flexibility we all need when we‚Äôre working on a complex e-commerce project. If you‚Äôre not already using these kinds of tools, it‚Äôs worth considering how they can streamline your workflow and help you deliver more value to clients.

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about:‚Äútwo unexpected client types that can benefit from Shopify Hydrogen‚Äù

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

As developers, we‚Äôre well aware of the power Shopify Hydrogen brings to the table, especially for big brands that need flexibility and high performance. But what if I told you it‚Äôs not just the industry giants that can benefit from this tool? Two other types of clients -ambitious brands with big goals and small brands eager to stand out - can also gain significant advantages from Shopify Hydrogen.

### 1. Ambitious clients with big goals

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

You may have clients who are currently small but have big ambitions. They might not yet have the resources of a large corporation, but they have the vision to grow. For these clients, Shopify Hydrogen can be a strategic choice that offers a scalable, future-proof foundation.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Why Recommend Hydrogen?

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

‚Ä¢ Scalability:Hydrogen won‚Äôt limit your clients‚Äô growth. As their brand expands, this platform can grow with them.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

‚Ä¢Long-term benefits:Although Hydrogen may involve higher initial costs, its long-term benefits‚Äîlike improved performance and full customization‚Äîcan provide a strong return on investment as the client scales.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

‚Ä¢Content management flexibility:Pairing Hydrogen with a CMS like Sanity or Contentful gives your clients the ability to manage complex content with ease, making it easier to adapt as their needs evolve.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

‚Ä¢Performance optimization:Hydrogen enhances site speed and overall performance, which is crucial any e-commerce business.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Challenges:Keep in mind the increased dependency on developer expertise for ongoing updates and changes. While this might mean more work for you, it‚Äôs an investment in the long-term success of your client‚Äôs brand.

### 2. Small clients with a desire to stand out

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

You might also have clients who run smaller brands but want a website that truly sets them apart. For these clients, Shopify Hydrogen offers the ability to create a unique, eye-catching site even if they don‚Äôt require a ton of complex features.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Why Recommend Hydrogen?

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

‚Ä¢ Simple and unique design:Hydrogen allows you to create a website that stands out without being overly complicated. It gives you, the developer, full control over the design and code (think about all ReactJs infrastructure/libraries), enabling your clients to express their brand identity clearly.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

‚Ä¢Fast and lightweight:Hydrogen is ideal for building a fast, streamlined user experience, which is crucial for smaller brands looking to make a big impression.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

‚Ä¢Creative freedom:For clients tired of cookie-cutter templates, Hydrogen offers the chance to build something truly distinctive.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Challenges:Even though the site may be straightforward, it still requires a developer who is proficient with Hydrogen. This means your clients will need to be prepared for the investment of time and resources. However, if their goal is to stand out in a crowded market, the effort is often worth it.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Final Thoughts

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Shopify Hydrogen isn‚Äôt just a tool for the big players. As a developer, understanding its strengths and how it can serve both ambitious and small clients will allow you to offer better guidance and deliver solutions that align with their goals. By helping clients navigate the challenges and leverage the benefits of Hydrogen, you can position yourself as a trusted partner in their journey toward growth and differentiation.

Recently, I‚Äôve started freelancing more intensively, and I‚Äôve come to see that while it can be enjoyable, it also comes with the challenge of balancing client communication with the actual work, which requires careful management.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Yet, these interactions are what make freelancing so fascinating. Working with a variety of clients and projects keeps things dynamic and exciting. Each new client is an opportunity to learn about different industries, understand unique business challenges, and broaden my perspective on just how vast and diverse the world truly is.

I‚Äôm looking forward to what lies ahead and excited about the experiences and growth it will bring along the way.

Stay organized!

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Staying organized is key to being productive and successful, whether you‚Äôre running a business, managing projects, or handling personal tasks. Using a platform to keep track of your projects, tasks, clients, and meeting notes can streamline your workflow and help you stay on top of everything. Notion is a great tool for this, allowing you to create a customized workspace where you can store and access all your important information, collaborate with team members, and track your progress. With a centralized system, you can easily keep track of deadlines and responsibilities without losing important details.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Having a codebase for commonly used features is also a smart move. It saves time and effort by providing a reference point that can be easily integrated into new projects, ensuring consistency and efficiency. Time tracking is another crucial aspect of staying organized, especially if you‚Äôre juggling multiple projects or billing clients by the hour. Tools like Clockify help you monitor how much time you‚Äôre spending on different tasks, allowing you to optimize your workflow and ensure accurate billing.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Starting each day with a clear plan can make a big difference in maintaining focus and productivity. Creating a list of tasks you want to complete provides direction and helps you prioritize your efforts. Time blocking, or dedicating specific periods to different tasks, can further enhance productivity by reducing distractions and allowing you to concentrate fully on one task at a time. Using a journal to plan your day can be very effective for time blocking, giving you a visual representation of your schedule and helping you stay committed to your plan. By incorporating these strategies, you can improve your organization, boost your productivity, and achieve your goals more efficiently.

Hey everyone!

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Welcome to my 3rd contribution to the¬† [i_only_speak_liquid](https://ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com/) newsletter! I'm [Michael](https://www.storetasker.com/experts/michael-morgan?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-55-unveiling-shopify-s-new-style-settings-flexibility-at-your-fingertips), a freelance web developer and proud member of the [Storetasker](https://resources.storetasker.com/become-an-expert?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-49-all-about-fonts) network.

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Shopify has recently introduced a game-changing feature in the Flex sections developer preview‚ÄîStyle settings. This enhancement empowers developers with greater control over the design of Shopify themes by providing adaptable style properties that can respond to different breakpoints. Here's a deep dive into what these settings offer and how to leverage them in your themes.

### What Are Style Settings?

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Style settings are a new category of input settings designed to hold values that map directly to CSS properties. Unlike traditional input settings, these can hold different values for various breakpoints, ensuring responsive and flexible design control.

### Categories of Style Settings

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

There are two primary categories:

- Style Panel Settings: Pre-organized by Shopify, these settings map to common CSS property categories such as layout, size, and spacing.
- Style Input Settings: Coming soon, these settings will allow values adaptable by breakpoint, tied directly to specific CSS properties.

### Exploring Style Panel Settings

### Size Panel

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Thestyle.size_panelcontrols the width and height of elements. Here‚Äôs a quick example:

`{
  ""type"": ""style.size_panel"",
  ""id"": ""size"",
  ""label"": ""Size"",
  ""default"": {
    ""width"": ""25%"",
    ""height"": ""auto""
  }
}`
p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Supported properties include:

### Spacing Panel

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Thestyle.spacing_panelmanages padding and margin:

`{
  ""type"": ""style.spacing_panel"",
  ""id"": ""spacing"",
  ""label"": ""Spacing"",
  ""default"": {
    ""padding"": ""16px 2px"",
    ""margin"": ""0px""
  }
}`
p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

It supports shorthand and longhand properties for padding and margin, ensuring flexibility and precision.

### Layout Panel

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Thestyle.layout_panelcontrols layout properties such as direction, positioning, and alignment:

`{
  ""type"": ""style.layout_panel"",
  ""id"": ""layout"",
  ""label"": ""Layout"",
  ""default"": {
    ""display"": ""flex"",
    ""flex-direction"": ""row"",
    ""flex-wrap"": ""wrap"",
    ""gap"": ""20px"",
    ""justify-content"": ""flex-start"",
    ""align-items"": ""center""
  }
}`
p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Supported properties include:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Here is a preview of the settings within the Theme Customizer. The values shown are the default ones you set, and you can easily add other supported properties by clicking the ‚Äò+‚Äô icon.

### Utilizing Style Settings

### Accessing Style Settings

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

You can access these settings in Liquid using theidattribute:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Theme settings:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Section:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Block:

### Applying Style Settings

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Use theclass_listfilter to apply style settings to elements:

`<divclass=‚Äùwrapper{{block.settings.spacing|class_list}}‚Äù><divclass=""group {{ block.settings.layout | class_list }}"">{% content_for ‚Äúblocks‚Äù %}</div></div>{% schema %}
{
  ""name"": ""Group"",
  ""blocks"": [{""type"": ""@theme""}, {""type"": ""@app""}],
  ""settings"": [
    {
      ""type"": ""style.layout_panel"",
      ""id"": ""layout"",
      ""label"": ""Layout"",
      ""default"": {
        ""flex-direction"": ""column""
      }
    },
    {
      ""type"": ""style.spacing_panel"",
      ""id"": ""spacing"",
      ""label"": ""Spacing"",
      ""default"": {
        ""padding"": ""20px""
      }
    }
  ]
}
{% endschema %}`
p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

This method ensures that default values and merchant edits are applied consistently.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

You can also apply all of the block or section settings to a single element by doing the following:

`<divclass=""group {{ block.settings | class_list }}"">{% content_for ‚Äúblocks‚Äù %}</div>{% schema %}
{
  ""name"": ""Group"",
  ""blocks"": [{""type"": ""@theme""}, {""type"": ""@app""}],
  ""settings"": [
    {
      ""type"": ""style.layout_panel"",
      ""id"": ""layout"",
      ""label"": ""Layout"",
      ""default"": {
        ""flex-direction"": ""column""
      }
    },
    {
      ""type"": ""style.spacing_panel"",
      ""id"": ""spacing"",
      ""label"": ""Spacing"",
      ""default"": {
        ""padding"": ""20px""
      }
    }
  ]
}
{% endschema %}`

### Breakpoint-Specific Values

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

You can specify different values for different breakpoints using media queries. For instance:

`jsonCopy code
{
  ""type"": ""style.spacing_panel"",
  ""id"": ""spacing"",
  ""label"": ""Spacing"",
  ""default"": {
    ""padding"": ""20px"",
    ""margin"": ""10px"",
    ""@media (--mobile)"": {
      ""padding"": ""10px"",
      ""margin"": ""0px""
    }
  }
}`
p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Currently, only the mobile breakpoint is available, but more will be introduced soon.

### Previewing Your CSS

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Here, you can see all the default properties populated, as well as any properties you have overridden.

### Conclusion

### One learning as a freelancer:

Recording your client meetings

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

One invaluable lesson I've learned as a freelancer is the importance of recording client meetings. I use Loom for all the recordings that I do. To ensure transparency and respect your client's privacy, you can simply ask at the beginning of the meeting, ""I record all of my meetings, is that okay with you?"" Recording meetings allows you to revisit discussions and capture every detail, which is particularly useful for complex projects where numerous details are discussed. This practice helps prevent misunderstandings and ensures that nothing is forgotten.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Additionally, having a recorded record of your meetings can serve as evidence if any disputes or issues arise later on. It provides a clear account of what was agreed upon, protecting both you and your client. This added layer of security can help maintain a professional and trustworthy relationship, as both parties can refer back to the recordings if there are any discrepancies. Overall, recording meetings is a simple yet effective way to enhance communication and safeguard your freelance business.

Hey everyone!

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Welcome to my second contribution to the¬† [i_only_speak_liquid](https://ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com/) newsletter! I'm [Michael](https://www.storetasker.com/experts/michael-morgan?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-54-link-products-with-swatches), a freelance web developer and proud member of the [Storetasker](https://resources.storetasker.com/become-an-expert?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-49-all-about-fonts) network.

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I‚Äôve had a lot of clients in the past and some recently who want separate products in the back end linked on the front end. All clothing companies. The solution I will share below is an easy solution for both you and the client!

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

This setup is particularly advantageous if your customers shop by color and/or the size of your store's product catalog is rather small. For smaller stores with fewer products, having separate products for each variant can make the store look fuller and more robust. When these products are linked together via swatches on the front end, they appear as one cohesive product within the product page, providing a seamless and engaging user experience.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Additionally, if you advertise your products differently based on color, this method works exceptionally well. Each variant can have its unique URL, allowing for targeted marketing and improved SEO, as each color option can be optimized for search engines. This approach not only enhances the visual appeal and organization of your storefront but also allows for more flexible and effective marketing strategies. Overall, this solution provides both operational efficiency and marketing advantages, making it an excellent choice for many clothing companies.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Let‚Äôs dive into it!

### Step 1: Create/Edit Products to Link Together

- Create Linked ProductsFirst, navigate to your Shopify admin and go to the Products section. You will need to create separate products that you want to link together. For instance, if you have three different color variants of the same shirt, you would create three separate products.
- Add Variant Option & Product TagsAfter creating the products, add a new option for the product variant. This will be the attribute that links these products together, such as ""Color"".To link these products together on the front end, you need to add specific tags to each product. These tags should be the product handles of all the linked products. This way, each product is tagged with the handles of the other variants, allowing them to be identified and linked correctly on the front end. Ensure that each product has a unique URL handle that reflects its variant. You can find the product handle in the Search engine listing preview section.

### Step 2: Add Swatches to Store Files

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

To create a cohesive shopping experience, you'll need to add swatches that represent the different variants of your products.

- Create Swatch Images:Screenshot Method:Take a small screenshot of each product variant that accurately represents the color or style.Design Method:Create custom swatch images using a graphic design tool to ensure consistency and quality.
- Upload Swatch Images:Navigate to theContentsection in your Shopify admin, then click onFiles.Upload your swatch images here. Make sure to follow a consistent naming convention for your swatch files. The file name should be in the formatswatch-. This will help the code to correctly identify and use the swatch images.
- For example:swatch-test-orange.pngswatch-test-cream.pngswatch-test-green.png

- If no swatch image is provided for a variant, the CSS code will display a background color based on the variant name. For example, iftest-orangehad no swatch file, it would default to a generic orange background color.
- Note that these generic background colors will only work for color names supported by CSS. For instance, common color names like ""orange"" will display correctly, but unsupported names like ""cream"" will not have an appropriate background color.

### Step 3: Add the Code

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

For this example, we are using the Dawn theme. We'll be making three main modifications: first, we will modify theproduct-variant-picker.liquidsnippet to include a conditional statement that checks whether the variant is a color and if so, renders a new snippet for the product swatch linking code. Next, we will create the new Liquid snippet namedcustom-product-variant-options.liquidwhich will handle displaying the color swatches and linking the products. Lastly, we will create a new CSS file namedcustom-product-variant-options.cssto style the color swatches.

### Modifyingproduct-variant-picker.liquid

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Whether you are using the Dawn theme or not, you will need to find the section where it loops through when the picker type isbutton. Then, add a Liquid tag to assign certain variables and create a conditional statement to check whether it is a color variant. If it is a color variant, render the new snippet. You can reference the screenshot below, where you can find the modifications within the red square.

### Creatingcustom-product-variant-options.liquid

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Create a new snippet namedcustom-product-variant-options.liquid. This snippet will handle displaying the color swatches and linking the products. Include a reference to a new CSS file at the top.

Once all the code is added, make sure the products are all set to 'active'. Then, preview the theme to ensure everything is working correctly. You should see all the connected products displayed as swatches, similar to the image below. If you are not seeing this, double-check your code for errors and ensure it is set up like the examples provided.

### Putting It All Together

Separate your life and work

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

One of the most crucial lessons I‚Äôve learned as a freelancer is the importance of separating life and work. When you work from home, the boundaries between professional and personal life can blur, leading to burnout and decreased productivity. Establishing a clear distinction between these two aspects of your life is essential for maintaining mental health, achieving work-life balance, and ensuring sustained productivity.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

First and foremost, create a dedicated workspace solely for work-related activities. This physical separation can help you mentally transition into work mode when you‚Äôre in that space and switch off when you leave. Additionally, setting specific work hours and adhering to them can reinforce this boundary, ensuring that work doesn‚Äôt encroach on personal time. For instance, avoid checking emails or taking work calls outside your designated hours. Communicate these boundaries to clients and colleagues so they respect your time and space.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Moreover, integrating regular breaks into your work routine is vital. One effective method is the Pomodoro Technique. This time management strategy involves working in focused intervals, typically 25 minutes, followed by a short break of 5 minutes. After completing four intervals, or ""pomodoros,"" take a longer break of 15-30 minutes. This technique helps maintain concentration and productivity while ensuring you take frequent breaks to rest and recharge.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

During these breaks, take the opportunity to exercise, go for a walk, or simply stand up and stretch. These activities can rejuvenate your mind and body, preventing the physical strain and mental fatigue that often come with long hours of continuous work. A standing desk can be a valuable addition to your workspace, promoting better posture and reducing the risks associated with prolonged sitting. By prioritizing these breaks and making them a non-negotiable part of your day, you can maintain a healthier, more balanced lifestyle that supports both your professional and personal well-being.

Hey everyone!

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I'm thrilled to share my first contribution to the¬† [i_only_speak_liquid](https://ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com/) newsletter! I'm [Michael](https://www.storetasker.com/experts/michael-morgan?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-53-displaying-variant-specific-information-with-metafields), a freelance web developer and proud member of the [Storetasker](https://resources.storetasker.com/become-an-expert?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-49-all-about-fonts) network.

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

In the competitive world of e-commerce, providing detailed and variant-specific product information can significantly enhance your customers' shopping experience. By default, Shopify doesn't dynamically display variant metafields based on the selected variant. However, with a few tweaks, you can ensure that this information updates automatically as customers choose different options. In this developer guide, we'll walk you through creating variant metafields in Shopify and show you how to dynamically display these metafields using JavaScript.

#### Step 1: Creating Variant Metafields in Shopify

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

First, let's create variant metafields for your product variants. Shopify's admin interface makes it easy to manage metafields without any coding knowledge. Follow these steps:

- Navigate to Metafields Settings:In your Shopify admin panel, go toSettings>Custom Data > Variants
- Add a New Metafield Definition:Click onAdd definition.Define the metafield key and namespace (e.g.,custom.descriptionfor a description metafield).Select the content type (e.g.,Single line text,Multi-line text, etc.).In this example, we will use ‚ÄòMulti-line text‚ÄôClick ‚ÄòSave‚Äô
- Assign Metafields to Variants:Go toProductsand select the product you want to edit.Scroll down to theVariantssection and click on a variant.Add the desired information for each variant in the Metafields section at the bottom.

#### Step 2: Setting Up Your Shopify Theme

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Next, we'll update your Shopify theme to display the metafield based on the selected variant. We'll use a hidden select element to store the metafield values and JavaScript to update the display.

- Add the Hidden Select Element:In this example, we are using the Dawn theme, so we will add this element to the product-variant-picker.liquid snippet

- Add the Variant Metafield Display Element:There are a couple of ways to go about adding this.Add the element in the code files where you want it to displayThis could be anywhere in the product.liquid snippet or template depending on the themeAdd the element to a custom liquid block or section provided by the themeSince Dawn has a custom liquid block, we will add the element there

`<!-- Metafield display element --><divid=""variant-metafield"">{{ product.selected_or_first_available_variant.metafields.custom.description }}</div>`
- Locate a printed variant id element

- In the Dawn theme, this can be found within the product form
- The reason why we will use this element is because the native Dawn code updates the value attribute with the currently selected variant id. This will make it easy for us to fetch the currently selected variants' ID
- Note: not all themes are built the same. Some may have an element like this, and some may not. Most themes input the selected variant ID as a parameter in the URL once the variant is changed.

#### Step 3: Writing the JavaScript

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Finally, we'll write a JavaScript snippet to update the displayed metafield when the variant changes.

`<script>document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',function(){// Get the hidden variant ID inputconstvariantInput=document.querySelector('.product-form .product-variant-id');if(!variantInput)return;// Select the variant metafield display elementconstvariantMetafieldDisplay=document.getElementById('variant-metafield');// Select the hidden variant metafields select elementconsthiddenVariantMetafields=document.getElementById('hidden-variant-metafields');constupdateMetafieldDisplay=()=>{constselectedVariantId=variantInput.value;constselectedOption=hiddenVariantMetafields.querySelector(`option[value=""${selectedVariantId}""]`);if(selectedOption){console.log(selectedOption);constmetafieldValue=selectedOption.getAttribute('data-metafield');variantMetafieldDisplay.innerHTML=metafieldValue;}};// Create an observer instance linked to the callback functionconstobserver=newMutationObserver(updateMetafieldDisplay);// Start observing the target node for configured mutationsobserver.observe(variantInput,{attributes:true,attributeFilter:['value']});// Initial update on page loadupdateMetafieldDisplay();});</script>`

#### Step 4: Test the functionality

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Once you have all the code added, and you have filled out the variant metafield for variants of a product, preview the theme and head to the product. You should see the metafield appear where you placed it in Step 2.2. Go ahead and change the variant. If you see the metafield update every time you change the variant, hooray you did it! If not, go back through each step and make sure everything is linked together.

#### Putting It All Together

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

By following these steps, you can create and display variant-specific metafields dynamically in your Shopify store. This approach allows you to provide detailed, variant-specific information to your customers, enhancing their shopping experience and helping them make more informed purchasing decisions. Happy coding!

Trust your skills and your ability to learn

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Entering the world of freelancing can be daunting, especially when you're relatively new, like I was with just a few years of experience. The biggest lesson I've learned is to trust in your skills and your ability to learn. When I first started, I encountered many tasks and customizations I had never dealt with before. Despite not knowing all the answers right away, I chose to say yes to opportunities because I believed in my capacity to figure things out. This approach pushed me out of my comfort zone and forced me to grow.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Challenging yourself is the best way to advance in any career, particularly as a developer. The process of tackling new problems, researching solutions, and learning new techniques is incredibly rewarding. Each time you overcome a hurdle, you not only expand your knowledge but also build confidence in your abilities. The satisfaction of solving a tough problem and seeing your skills evolve in real time is incomparable.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

This mindset has been instrumental in my development journey. It‚Äôs about having the courage to take on tasks that seem difficult and trusting that you can rise to the occasion. By continually pushing yourself, you open up new possibilities and pave the way for continuous improvement and success.

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

When working with Shopify themes, I've found Git + Github¬† to be an instrumental tool to manage and control deployment of site changes. Many of you reading this might already know about this, but in case you don't, let's do a quick walkthrough on how you can pull down a Shopify site's code to manage it in a more controlled manner.

#### 1. Download your site‚Äôs code

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Start by installing the [Shopify CLI](https://shopify.dev/docs/themes/tools/cli/installation?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-52-integrating-with-github) (Command Line Interface), it's practically a must-have when working with themes. Once it's installed, open a terminal window and navigate to a folder where you'll download the theme files. Here's a simple example.

cd~/Development/shopify-themesmkdirmy-client-theme &&cdmy-client-theme

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

and then download your theme code with...

shopify theme pull --store{store-name}

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

This will prompt you to login with your browser. Once complete, the terminal output will provide your list of themes, select the one you want to download.

#### 2. Initialize Git

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Now that you've got your theme files, lets initialize a new Git repository. This sets up the necessary files and folders for version control.

git init

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Make an initial commit to get things rollin'

git add .git commit -m""Initial commit""

#### 3. Push your theme code to GitHub

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Log in to your Github account and create a new repository. Don't worry about initializing it with a README, .gitignore, or license. Take note of the URL for your new repository. Back in the terminal, let's add this repository as aremoterepository.

git remote add origin[https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-52-integrating-with-github)

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Remember to replace that link with your new repository URL, as well as the.gitextension at the end of it.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Nearly there! Let's push our local code files to the Github repository:

gitpush-uoriginmain

#### 4. Connect GitHub to Shopify

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

You'll need to install the [Shopify Github App](https://github.com/apps/shopify?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-52-integrating-with-github) to complete this final step. This will allow the connection between Shopify and GitHub.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Then in Shopify, navigate again to theThemessection of the Shopify admin. Under the Theme library section, click Add theme > Connect from GitHub. Follow the steps to select your GitHub repository and the ""main"" branch. Voila!

### Final Word

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

With git integrated into your workflow, you can manage different versions of your site with ease, whether it's creating a theme to QA your code before pushing it to live, or a temporary / seasonal version, you'll have mastery over the changes.

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I‚Äôve been spending an increased amount of time with embedded Shopify applications. This inspired my last post, and it inspires today‚Äôs, too. When I began my journey becoming a Shopify developer, I was incredibly impressed by Shopify‚Äôs dedication to providing excellent resources to devs, and today we‚Äôll be covering one of those very resources: Shopify Polaris.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Polaris is Shopify's open-source design system, a collection of guidelines and resources aimed at helping you build consistently beautiful and user-friendly Shopify apps. With the release of version 12, it's better than ever, offering new features and improvements to make your development experience smoother and more efficient.

### Why Polaris?

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

You might wonder why Shopify would go through the trouble of creating and maintaining Polaris for developers. The answer is simple: consistency, efficiency, and a better user experience. By providing a unified design language and common components, Shopify ensures that all apps and interfaces look and feel cohesive. This not only benefits end-users but also makes your job as a developer much easier.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Let‚Äôs take a look at some of the highlights of what Polaris provides to us as Shopify designers and developers:

#### Components

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Ah, components, the heart of any modern web application. Shopify offers a wide array of pre-built UI elements that you can drop directly into your applications. Polaris covers everything from layout components to help you standardize the architecture of your pages, to common form inputs and action buttons which handle a majority of common user interactions. These components are designed to be flexible and customizable, allowing you to tailor them to your specific needs while maintaining a consistent look and feel.

#### Accessibility & Internationalization Coverage

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

We want to make sure our applications work foreveryone, and Polaris has us covered here. The included components cover features like built-in ARIA attributes, making them easy to use with keyboards and screen readers. Plus, there are handy guidelines to help you nail the accessibility standards, covering everything from color contrast to focus management. As for internationalization, Shopify continues to provide us with support for easily handling multiple languages and currencies just as they do in their storefront support.

#### Icons & Tokens

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Last but not least, we can leverage Polaris‚Äô icons and token system to give our app that distinct Shopify vibe. The token system is a series of variables that Shopify itself uses to standardize things such as color, typography, and spacing. Combining the usage of these tokens and the provided icon library will provide that last layer of polish to an app, making it feel like it was built by Shopify itself. This seamless integration means your app will blend perfectly with the Shopify platform, offering users a smooth, cohesive experience. Using these tools not only saves you time but also ensures your app looks professional and on-brand, just like Shopify intended.

### Bonus DX Tooing

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Shopify has included some bonus developer tools to make your experience implementing Polaris even better:

#### Figma Plugin

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

For the designer, the [Polaris Figma plugin](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1293611962331823010/polaris-components?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-51-build-your-app-with-polaris) is a must-have. This plugin allows you to access Polaris components directly within Figma, making it easier than ever to design and prototype your Shopify apps. You‚Äôll ensure that your design aligns perfectly with the Polaris guidelines, speeding up the handoff process to developers.

#### VS Code Extension

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

For the developer, Shopify offers a [Polaris for VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shopify.polaris-for-vscode&utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-51-build-your-app-with-polaris). This handy tool provides code snippets, linting, and other features that make it easier to implement Polaris components and follow best practices directly within your favorite code editor.

#### Polaris Sandbox

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

While still in alpha, the Polaris sandbox is a handy and fun playground where you can experiment with components, tokens, and design principles without affecting your live projects. It's a great way to try out new ideas, test changes, and see how different elements work together before integrating them into your app. In fact, I just took a moment to [whip a little something](https://polaris.shopify.com/playroom/index.html?code=N4Igxg9gJgpiBc4IDsDOAXABAbXQCwENkBrATQgFcAaTVGdAFUJPIoF1MBeTCugZXQF0MABQAdEBICUY5LIBmFZGHQBLFJj6rkAcwA2MAMJ4IqsDAAyqjAFEAHgQC2ABwMipmYLMyZIaLNh0BiowUDR06HwwwcJQHNy8MAJCotgA5ADMaWxSANyy3r4oGJjMUAbGRDowXDx0hgR6egBGBGDEIiIAbo0UMB6cAHy09FExod29-TTYOflyyD4ATvQUS4viiz6YADzGpuZWGIXbmGroBpwSABIQAO6Yd5R6UJgAnpSYSylneNaYBCWajABgA-BITtswCYzDBUJxgNhIadgJg9ARmtF4Jg0oAFajSNB6ej62LSAEY0pgAL5UZHbVHozF6Um4-GEqakgBMlJpdJ8DIxWJxrLZmCJJJxWWptK2p35aMFzOFIoJYo5OIALDyZXL6QqmSyRaLxTBSQBWbV0thUulBGAhKAIu0Om2y7YoSq6GAIsoVZjVV2nAD0g0KeVkrtkOwACgRqmdVBdvRImERiO9KBJQ1sdgAhPQQdrJdqYHQEZxXECcgAM1azkL2jQLFHQDSWUDp50uKeYxFQmHkECWXxgBCg2h0AEIIW6fKomrx0N81ChK3h0OhnKh4EGg2AoMgAHSoEzOVTyN6HyCOIOoIMEVARO9jxzaPd4e3ESjoW-0NS6VAAFowEXCBXwAL3tQF0EAgB2aszXkM1YLAWDOTNNoEMxDCMg1e0azALCAE4NU5IiAA4wGaciCHkKAyWrAg2lg5ooCI1Cx2rGsMmreQNUo%2BQCGrY8uh0GddWcJZVEcQE3gAQRUdRkARVE-GEZB0FJCxRy6GoCBHLpVBgO5VTWJUJAAYhWQzjIkalA22bNdR2ZxBgASVKCBnBqD4KEwGBkAAKwgN5QkwRw3kwCBdKWGyHggeRNFPc9IujCB0Sk1BD12INXIbIMGiab82ygJztkbdsvkoZBYCgOTmmi5MQFQRx61nXYGBgOwsAfNdOTsnopKIdA11HcddD4VqQDK3U0oy-4%2BCIKAGrsOkdiDTrupm8rcwgOxMGcMdxp0fNC2ISsazraa%2BQ6rqevhCRnAGwFVGGysGqgN4AFkO2u9rTjc1BkDSLB8H%2BSS-0i5BR3QcF-pyzb0G2nx1t2uxkd2NGDqOidTqLQQgQu2s2t1FHEYBB6QCekA1SGjT3ugb7foxgHHj%2BZxvNeMH%2BwoZwKYBTBYEcCBMECxczhFk97jAB8ajuQhQY-WglpW3wiEFiBspunxDDA5ptBqbnHkTPBfhqOaXv7KBC37JaMz8mXFgARwoMxiD0SLJIgdBvbebzMGhh5r2cFAAvQftB2HXzh3LZxp3h9bEYx1G9u29aSrTjO1vHLpMFUR0JGsoy7hJuUdgAMSHRwWfK8neokPB%2BppwbXvphuxonSbS9J7Zy5gUJWnabWEbumuUa0XQ-QOSxrHQewnFcGoQ2HvM9uxqBjrx86JEu7ue92NzkD0A3i3TMsKx34m-v3naWx9xYW7ex6pJkpY3jsj1j-aBF3C4YYIlTCwSgIg0iAPTKwNIUgqSDD4BQZor50CozvigMetdR7AHwGmVgVJE6j2HijIMh9j7Q1PqglO6M1pBkrksaulCc5pwKoCUqhRUYFnxm0Yg2Z1qxmqNmEAVAQD4BgI4OECBsAgDYY0U0AUQBsAEXcfO%2BBUBiOtEAA&utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-51-build-your-app-with-polaris) up for you all‚Ä¶

### Final Word

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

We touched on a number of things regarding Polaris, but there‚Äôs plenty more. Their documentation provides further tips and guidance for when working with the design system, as well as mentions of future features - I‚Äôm personally looking forward to their potential support for [View Transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transitions_API?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-51-build-your-app-with-polaris) soon!

I am fortunate to have received quite a few requests for proposals in 2024. In the earlier stages of my freelance career, I‚Äôd get so excited about these proposals that my brain would already consider the project ‚Äúin play‚Äù and I‚Äôd start prep work or sometimes full-blown development. However,veryfew of these projects actually get signed off by the client. I wish I had some statistics for you, but if I had to guess I‚Äôd say one in four ideas or projects that I discuss with clients moves forward to a contract. Make sure you don‚Äôt count your chickens before they hatch! And while being prepared to act quickly when the project is ready for your talents, be careful not to sink too much time into something that may not come to pass.

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

As we approach the release of the next Shopify Editions this summer, I wanted to take a moment to highlight an impactful piece of technology that Shopify announced in last summer's Editions: The default template for building new Shopify applications would be powered by Remix. I think now would be a great time to review this move, including the history and motivations behind Shopify's acquisition of the framework.

### A Brief Overview of Remix

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

[Remix](https://remix.run/?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-50-a-review-on-remix) is a full-stack React meta-framework, [first released](https://remix.run/blog/remix-v1?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-50-a-review-on-remix) in November 2021. You'll often hear about Remix in comparison to another popular React meta-framework, [Next.js](https://remix.run/?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-50-a-review-on-remix). Both are open-source efforts but Next has been managed by its backing company, Vercel, since its inception. Remix was initially created by [Michael Jackson](https://reactresources.com/people/michael-jackson?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-50-a-review-on-remix) and [Ryan Florence](https://reactresources.com/people/ryan-florence?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-50-a-review-on-remix), known typically for their excellent [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-50-a-review-on-remix) npm package, which as of the writing of this post, is being downloaded over [9 million times a week](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router?activeTab=dependencies&utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-50-a-review-on-remix)! ü§Ø

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

From the outset, Remix aimed to address the pain points that developers often face when building web applications that require sophisticated data handling, state management, and server-side rendering. By embracing a more unified approach to front-end and back-end development, Remix sought to bridge the gap between the two, enabling developers to build more cohesive and maintainable applications.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

A year after first Remix's V1 release Shopify [announced](https://shopify.engineering/remix-joins-shopify?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-50-a-review-on-remix) that they would be acquiring the framework. This underscored Shopify's dedication to remaining at the forefront of web development and their continued efforts to provide best-in-class development experience for our community. In the announcement, Shopify points to some reasons why Remix was a perfect fit, namely the framework's emphasis on

- Progressive enhancement
- Reducing / eliminating loading states
- Support for edge runtimes

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Throughout 2023, Remix would be woven into Shopify's infrastructure. It's now powering their headless stack [Hydrogen](https://hydrogen.shopify.dev/?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-50-a-review-on-remix) and is the [default template](https://www.shopify.com/editions/summer2023?filters=developer-updates&product=remix-app-template&utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-50-a-review-on-remix) when building new Shopify Apps.

### Features & Impact

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Let's take a look at some of the reasons Shopify was inspired to bring Remix in-house.

#### Simplified Data Loading and State Management

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

If you plan on creating a storefront with Hydrogen, or building Shopify Apps, Remix's approach to data loading and state management is a game-changer. One of the challenges developers often face when working with e-commerce platforms is the need to manage and fetch data from various sources, such as product catalogs, inventory systems, and customer data. This process can quickly become complex, leading to convoluted code and increased maintenance overhead.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Remix takes an opinionated approach and introduces the concept of route loaders and actions. Theloaderfunction is used to provide data to your route, and theactionfunction is used to perform data mutations.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

With the loader and action API being the same, Remix allows you to [co-locate](https://koenvangilst.nl/blog/code-colocation-is-king?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-50-a-review-on-remix) components, styles, and server-side code, simplifying the process of data fetching and mutations directly within the component files.

#### Improved Performance and SEO

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Remix places a strong emphasis on performance, leveraging techniques like server rendering, code splitting, and optimized data fetching. With server-side rendering, Remix ensures that the initial page load is handled on the server, resulting in faster rendering times and improved SEO. Additionally, Remix's code splitting capabilities allow for efficient loading of application code, further enhancing performance and improving the overall user experience. See below:

If you're working with a merchant that has to handle and process returns frequently, I'd highly recommend checking out Loop Returns. I recently helped a client get up and running with is tool and was very impressed by the user experience. With Loop, customers can enter their order number, see each product that was included in that order, and request a refund or an exchange for a different item. It streamlines the returns process in a way that feels exceptional.

### One learning as a freelancer:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I've always had a lot of interests in the tech and development space. I've tried to stay well rounded as I grow and I've touted my jack-of-all-trades persona for a long time. More recently, however, I've been mulling over the idea that there are more things I want to learn/build than there is time to do them. I'm certainly not the first to think this, but I'm only now internalizing the idea. If you feel like you're ""stretched thin,"" consider [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtYM7DmQq2A&utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-50-a-review-on-remix) from Cal Newport about how doing less is the best way to become more valuable. Saying ""no"" to a project can be tough, and sometimes it's a privilege to have that luxury, but I think Cal's points are useful to consider when assessing your workload and the direction you want to go in.

For merchants, an essential part of the e-commerce experience is communicating your brand through your store. One of the pillars of brand design is selecting your brand's fonts, as they're a great way to establish recognition and define the tone of your brand.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Shopify makes it easy for merchants to change their online store's fonts through the theme editor. Most themes have aTypographysetting that allows you to choose from one of the many Shopify-hosted fonts. However, what happens if the merchant needs to use a font that Shopify hasn't licensed? Furthermore, if this third-party font isn't hosted, how do we implement it on our site? Let's explore the answers to the questions today.

#### 1. Host your font

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

The first thing we need to figure out is where will our font files be hosted? If the merchant has the raw font files, we can add them to our codebase and they'll be hosted by Shopify alongside the rest of our site. These files will end in either .woff, or .woff2 file extensions. Keep in mind that different variations (Light, Semi-Bold, Bold, etc.) of the font may have their own font file.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

With our font files in hand, open up your theme's codebase on your machine and copy them into the /assets folder. It's totally fine if you have both a .woff and .woff2 file for each font weight (we'll handle this). In the example below, I added both the Bold (font-weight: 700) and Black (font-weight: 900) weights of the Brice font family to my theme.

#### 2. Declare your fonts

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Next, we'll need to declare our fonts. This step involves telling the browser how to fetch and use your font files.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

[!attention] Heads up! The remaining steps will vary depending on how your theme manages its stylesheets. I'll show you one way that should cover most cases.üí™

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Create a file called custom-fonts.css.liquid inside the assets folder.Make surethat this file ends in .liquid! I lost valuable time debugging an issue with custom fonts by forgetting this step.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

For each font weight that we've added from the previous step, we'll need to declare a font-face. Again using the Brice example, see the font-face declarations below:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

What's happening here?

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Well, these font declarations act as a map for our CSS styles to find the right font. We'll see this in action in a later step -- remember this moment!üí≠Also, note the use of Liquid syntax here; the asset_url filter helps us out by handling the final URL of our font files, we just have to make sure the file names are correct and that they're in the assets folder.

#### 3. Include your font

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Moving on! Let's make sure our third-party fonts are available everywhere in our theme. Locate your theme.liquid file and add the following line within the <head> tags:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

What's happening here?

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

In the last step, we declared our fonts in a new file (custom-fonts.css.liquid), but that doesn't mean those fonts areavailable to us toapply to elements yet. We mustincludethe file containing them, and now we have!

#### 4. Apply your fonts

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

With our fonts hosted, defined, and included, we can now apply them to elements in our site. As mentioned before, different themes and their application of CSS will vary. Many themes will have a stylesheet that covers the theme more generally, like theme.css, theme.css.liquid, base.css, or base.css.liquid. Navigate to the proper file for your situation, and try to add CSS rules for font-family to a couple of elements of your third-party font. Here's my example:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

What's happening here?

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Remember when we declared two font faces earlier, one for Brice Bold (700) and Brice Black (900)? The CSS rule here will find the @font-face we declared which has a font-family value of ""Brice"" and a font-weight value of 700, and use that ""map"" to pull the correct font. So make sure your font-family values are the same in the CSS rule and the @font-face declaration!

#### 5. Test & celebrate your fonts

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

At this point you'll probably see your fonts being applied to whatever elements you've targeted. If you aren't, or if you want to verify the success of the setup, you can use your browser's developer tools to do so. Navigate to the Network tab, filter the requests for .woff files and locate the request for your font file. You should see something like the screenshot below

#### Bonus: Tie settings in with your font

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

It should be noted that third-party fonts, self-hosted or hosted by another (i.e. Google Fonts), will never be selectable through a font_picker setting. If you want to give the merchant the flexibility of modifying the font family and weights that are applied in their site, we'll need to create a custom font picker solution. It might look something like this:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

A few notes on this:

- I would probably remove the font weights we'renotusing so the merchant doesn't have the option to select a weight that isn't supported.
- The id value of these two settings indicates that this custom font should be applied toheadings. You may want to repeat these settings for body text, links, menus, etc. Just make sure to update your id values so they are unique
- You'll also need to manage the linking up of this setting with your theme, but this should get you started!

No one could have prepared me for how different the daily existence would be when you switch from being employed by another to self-employed. There are some incredible benefits, but there's also a very particular set of obstacles, especially mentally and emotionally, that you need to learn to handle.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

We all have a metaphorical""well""of cognitive resources everyday, and it drains as we focus and solve our daily challenges. If we don't ensure proper management of this well, it will start to affect your emotional wellbeing, physical wellbeing, and your work! When you're a freelancer, treating this well with care can be a slippery experience. You might feel like you're always ""on,"" and the anxiety of not getting paid consistently becomes a magnet for overexerting yourself. Try to get in tune with your well, learn how to fill it, recognize when it's depleted, and feel OK about things when it‚Äôs empty.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

It has been documented in different ways and it‚Äôs widely accepted that consistency will always beat out intensity when it comes to progressing towards a goal. Institute good habits, be kind to yourself, and make time for non-work activities like socializing, meditation and play... you'll be happier, healthier, and more prolific! Play the long game!

Hey everyone!

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Welcome back to [i_only_speak_liquid](https://ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com/?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-45-product-recommendations-tracking-parameters) - I‚Äôm [Jocelyn](https://www.storetasker.com/experts/jocelyn-dunkley?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-45-product-recommendations-tracking-parameters), a [Storetasker](https://resources.storetasker.com/become-an-expert?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-45-product-recommendations-tracking-parameters) expert and front-end Shopify developer. This is my 4th and final edition of ‚Äúi only speak liquid‚Äù before another Storetasker expert takes the pen. So for one more time: Let‚Äôs gooo!

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

There‚Äôs been a little wave in the Shopify dev community after [Florescent themes](https://fluorescent.co/?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-48-theme-development-shutdown) announced at the end of last month that they will be retiring two of their themes, Ira and Context, in May 2024. It‚Äôs quite a rare thing for prominent theme developers to retire a theme. Fluorescent themes has four other themes on the Shopify theme store.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Being a theme developer on Shopify is a hard game. You‚Äôre expected to adapt to all Shopify updates (the biggest one recently was the Online Store 2.0 upgrade) and provide lifetime support to all customers. And in return receive a one-time payment from customers when they buy the theme. Essentially you have to keep selling your themes in order to fund and support your old customers‚Äô support tickets.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Additionally if you decide to become a Shopify theme partner you‚Äôre not allowed to market your themes on any other marketplace, such as [ThemeForest](https://themeforest.net/?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-48-theme-development-shutdown). The Shopify theme store obviously has the market domination on warm leads that will actually buy your Shopify theme. But still, it reduces your ability to diversify your marketing.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

it might have come to a point for Fluorescent themes where the theme wasn‚Äôt performing as they expected and the support load was costing them more money than they were making. It might have been a sensible financial move just to shut it down altogether and start over. On their Twitter/X they announced at the beginning of March that they are designing a new theme, so maybe that‚Äôs the conclusion they came to as well.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

What is clear at least is that the theme development environment on Shopify needs to change in order to sustain theme development companies and keep thousands of merchants supported. Some ideas I‚Äôve seen across the internet is to offer one year of ‚Äúfree‚Äù support then offer additional annual support subscriptions.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

If the conditions don‚Äôt improve for Shopify theme developers they might find that the best and most profitable route is to go rogue and sell directly to merchants or diversify to other marketplaces. Hopefully it doesn‚Äôt come down to that. Themes are an integral component of the Shopify ecosystem. Many brands wouldn‚Äôt be as successful without the hard work and dedication of theme developers to provide beautiful and easy to use themes.

- Mobile simulator - responsive testing toolThis tool is great to test for every possible screen size and device known to man and find any bugs associated with a specific device size. A couple builds ago the ecom manager I was working with was testing the site on a iPhone 15 Pro Max, which is a screen size that a lot of development sizes don't account for. We were having lots of confusion back and forth because I couldn‚Äôt see the issues she was having. After I found this extension I was able to find the issues and now I use it all the time in my builds. Because it‚Äôs embarrassing to have worked on a build for so long but somehow didn‚Äôt account for that ONE screen size condition where everything goes haywire.

This app is great to extend the customer area with additional forms if you need certain types of information from certain customers. I‚Äôve used this in multiple situations.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

For example, one of my clients had to verify that each of their customers from Vermont had registered businesses. If the customer‚Äôs default address was set to Vermont and they didn‚Äôt upload the form they could not checkout. So we used Helium Customer Fields to set up a form upload area in the customer app that we would use to check and block the checkout button if necessary.

The Helium team is also developer-first. They have a great help section as well as a developer-focused area for more advanced customizations if you need to use their frontend JS API or REST API.

One of your lead generation strategies should be to partner with larger agencies or other service providers that offer complimentary services.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Think about the services that are needed before you and after you. For example, as a developer, a client needs a site designed before they need you to develop it. So you could partner with designers that don‚Äôt like to or can‚Äôt code to be their go-to developer. Then after the site is developed, a client could need marketing services or SEO services. Then you could partner with a marketing agency or SEO consultant to implement recommendations.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Something simple to think about, but it‚Äôs helpful for you and on the client side to be a part of the full cycle of services a client could need.

Hey everyone!

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Welcome back to [i_only_speak_liquid](https://ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com/?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-45-product-recommendations-tracking-parameters) - I‚Äôm [Jocelyn](https://www.storetasker.com/experts/jocelyn-dunkley?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-45-product-recommendations-tracking-parameters), a [Storetasker](https://resources.storetasker.com/become-an-expert?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-45-product-recommendations-tracking-parameters) expert and front-end Shopify developer. This is my 3rd edition of 4 newsies, let‚Äôs gooo!

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Recently I‚Äôve been focusing on site speed optimization for a few clients. I‚Äôve been doing some experiments to see what techniques have worked for me. I‚Äôd like to share that with you today.

- Ruthlessly analyze what scripts you need

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

The general recommendation is to defer or async scripts so they don't block the main rendering action. This is helpful for scripts that are necessary on the page, but there are often 3rd party scripts that are always loaded, even if they are not used on the page. In order to truly keep the page lightweight, I started conditionally loading scripts based on what kind of template they are on.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I‚Äôve been using this [app optimization section](https://sections.design/blogs/shopify/app-optimization?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-47-site-speed-learnings) built by Mircea Piturca of [sections.design](http://sections.design?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-47-site-speed-learnings) to do this functionality. You can either entirely block a script on certain pages, load it on scroll or load it on a specific event.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

However the app optimization section doesn‚Äôt detect everything. So for other situations I conditionally render the script by myself:

[View Code here](https://www.thiscodeworks.com/embed/660acf11f47d130014a432dd?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-47-site-speed-learnings)
- Make sure only the images ‚Äúabove the fold‚Äù are loaded eagerly

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I found out that one of my clients‚Äô featured collection slideshow section was loading the first four product images eagerly and the rest were lazy loading. This makes sense assuming you always need to see the first row of products immediately. But it meant that there were 24 images below the fold that were being eagerly loaded. This was unnecessary and wasted precious loading time.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

To fix this I created a theme setting that the user could select if they wanted this section‚Äôs visible images to be lazy loaded or eagerly loaded. If the featured collection slideshow section would be visible above the fold, then they would click eager loading, otherwise, it would be lazy loaded.

- If possible - reduce the length of the webpage on mobile

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

One overall problem for a client was that the DOM content was too large, especially on mobile. My client had 13 sections in total on their homepage. Customers would ideally find what they were looking for before scrolling all the way to the bottom. I proposed adding a theme setting so the client could choose if a section should be shown in desktop, mobile or both.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

This is a classic app to keep customers in the sales process even when your product is sold out. Customers stay notified when a certain product goes back in stock. You can gauge customer interest in certain products when restocking products so you don‚Äôt overbuy. You can also allow customers to preorder your products. I think this app‚Äôs back in stock notification features are stronger and more reliable than the preorder settings. If you need granular preorder controls such as selecting what variants can be preordered and the max preorder amount, then I recommend another app like [Preorder Globo | Back in Stock](https://apps.shopify.com/pre-order-pro?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-47-site-speed-learnings).

Following up is the key to success.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Whether business is going well for you or not, following up with your leads and current clients is necessary to move business along. Many freelancers get deterred if a lead doesn‚Äôt reply to them the first time. However the ball is in your court. Give them the benefit of the doubt. Maybe they‚Äôre busy, they saw your email but forgot to reply (I‚Äôm guilty of this) or something else. Have confidence in your services and politely follow up.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I do a 3 email follow-up sequence. I always end the last email with ‚ÄúHave you already found a solution for your INSERT PROBLEM HERE or are you still looking for support?‚Äù I was able to use this strategy to convert 3 leads that replied to me on the 3rd email into clients last month.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I even follow up with clients who don‚Äôt outright reject me but for some reason it didn‚Äôt work out. I make a note in my calendar to follow up in 1-3 months. I reach out to see if they are interested in the same project or need additional support for something else.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

If they were ok with my prices but it wasn‚Äôt the right opportunity, keeping in touch is always a win-win. It‚Äôs only a matter of time and persistence before they‚Äôll reach out because you were diligently contacting them every so often. The key is not being pushy and always providing value in some way.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I hope you enjoyed this edition. If you have any feedback, or better ways to do the things I touched on, let me know your thoughts!

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Over the past month Shopify has announced the depreciation of a couple of core apps and features. The two notable ones are the [Product Reviews app](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/products/product-reviews?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-46-shopify-s-deprecated-apps) and the [Geolocation app](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/markets/international-domains/directing-customers/geolocation?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-46-shopify-s-deprecated-apps), which will be deprecated on May 6th and December 1st, respectively.

Shopify has notoriously launched apps and then not allocated any dev resources to updating them. Some examples are the [Planet app](https://apps.shopify.com/planet?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-46-shopify-s-deprecated-apps), [Digital Downloads app](https://apps.shopify.com/digital-downloads?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-46-shopify-s-deprecated-apps) and [Fraud Filter app](https://apps.shopify.com/fraud-filter?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-46-shopify-s-deprecated-apps).

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Both aforementioned apps have been removed from the app store, but from my memory they also didn‚Äôt have many updates after the initial release. However, from my experience both apps worked well, albeit sometimes a bit finicky.

What does this signal about Shopify?
p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I understand why they are deprecating the Geolocation app. Over the years Shopify has made advancements in their localization redirection technologies that make the Geolocation app redundant. These include expansion in their automation redirection feature, automation browser language redirection andconsolidation of the GeoIP feature. Now Shopify Markets should be enough for most merchants to manage redirections to various markets.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

On the other hand, deprecating the Product Reviews app seems like a forced cash grab. It is compatible with Online Store 2.0 themes and the functionality is generally fine. I know Shopify tries to give as much opportunity to app developers as possible, but in this case I believe product reviews are a core feature to any ecommerce platform. Shopify‚Äôs model so far has been to offer the most basic features as free and let the 3rd party apps take care of any fancy features. They‚Äôve done this for Subscriptions, Translations, Search & Filter and more.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Shopify seems to be wanting to go up-market so maybe this is part of their strategy. All I hope is that by letting these apps go, they will be able to gather more dev resources for bigger and better features that will positively impact everyone.

[Wholesale Pricing Discount B2B](https://apps.shopify.com/wholesale-pricing-discount?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-46-shopify-s-deprecated-apps)

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

This app is great for B2B clients that have varying prices for different customer tiers. I‚Äôve used this for all of my B2B clients and it's been extremely straightforward. The team takes care of setting up the required coding snippets within your theme. One feature I love is that you can have custom prices per variant which is super helpful for honing in on your specific pricing.

### One learning as a freelancer:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Hone in on your freelancing skill sets rather than branch out to many other skills. A¬† lot of freelancers at the start of their journey think it‚Äôs better to offer as many skills as possible because broader skills === more clients, right? Actually, more often than not it‚Äôs the opposite. Clients are confused about what you do. When clients look to hire they are looking for the best person that can solve their specific problem. If you‚Äôre just one person you will not convince clients that you are an expert in branding marketing, coding and PR. It‚Äôs better to hone in on one skills, such as coding and be THE coding person.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

The funny thing is, the longer I‚Äôve been freelancing, the more I‚Äôve found that I can learn within my skill. Clients will come to you because you can code good websites. But within a high quality website there‚Äôs accessibility, site speed, SEO, general code quality, and more. It can be even more powerful to be THE site speed person or THE accessibility person.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

When I first started freelancing I did everything under the sun in order to explore my possibilities. I built MVPs for startups, contracted for software agencies, built one-page personal sites, worked on WooCommerce and Shopify sites, and even got a lucrative contract working for a government contractor (that‚Äôs a story for another day).

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I found my passion in ecommerce and decided to go for Shopify. Of course it was scary to technically be offering less. But as mentioned before, as you dive deeper into a topic you find there‚Äôs so much more to enhance. It‚Äôs easier to market yourself, easier to have your mind in one place and ultimately, I‚Äôm as busy as ever. So it worked out in the end üòÄ

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

One of our retainer client‚Äôs SEO consultants came to me about an issue with Shopify‚Äôs product recommendation URLs in Google Search Console. I didn‚Äôt know this, but Shopify adds many [tracking IDs](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/ajax/reference/product-recommendations?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-45-updated-product-recommendations-tracking-parameters#tracking-conversions-for-product-recommendations) into the product recommendation URLs in order to create reports.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

For example:

/products/gorgeous-wooden-computer?pr_choice=default&pr_prod_strat=description&pr_rec_pid=13&pr_ref_pid=17&pr_seq=alternating
p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

This was causing the Shopify site to experience a below par internal structure that made it unnecessarily difficult for crawlers to crawl all the pages within the website. The tracking parameters were good for internal Shopify statistics, but it also created 10 times the amount of unique URLs the crawler had to follow.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

There are 2 options to fix this:

- If you don‚Äôt care about tracking recommended product performance: Strip the tracking data from the URLs likehttps://great-website.com/products/white-leather-holiday-short-blue-triminstead ofhttps://great-website.com/products/white-leather-holiday-short-blue-trim?pr_prod_strat=copurchase&pr_rec_id=3330c9992&pr_rec_pid=8835401843011&pr_ref_pid=8835398336835&pr_seq=uniform. This way we profit from the extra internal links, but lose the tracking possibilities within Shopify.
- If you want to track performance: Add ‚Äúrel=‚Äônofollow‚Äô‚Äù to the link. This solution will keep the tracking within Shopify, but the crawler will ignore those links.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

The client didn‚Äôt care about tracking the recommended product performance so we went with option #1

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I achieved this with the following change to the recommended products URL:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

It was quite a simple solution but it was an interesting process learning about the impact of tracking on SEO.

### 1 app I like:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

[Loop Subscriptions](https://apps.shopify.com/loop-subscriptions?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-45-updated-product-recommendations-tracking-parameters)

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

3 reasons why I love Loop:

- You can completely customize the subscription widget look and feel in Liquid directly in the app. No more hacky CSS like in Recharge
- Amazing customer service and free white glove migration from other subscription apps
- They now offer bundles!

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

In 2022 I had a client that was looking to migrate from Bold subscriptions to another app. I did a deep dive of 8 different apps. I got on sales calls and tested them out on my development store. I decided to recommend Loop because the customer service was fantastic and the app was robust and hit all of the client‚Äôs pain points. I even became one of their [first agency partnerships](https://loopsubscriptions.partnerpage.io/agencies?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-45-updated-product-recommendations-tracking-parameters). Go check it out if you need a new subscription app!

### One learning as a freelancer:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Context is key for a project. It‚Äôs why getting on a call is so important. Sometimes as developers we just take a task and run with it without asking any questions. But taking the time to really understand the business, the project and why it‚Äôs needed can be invaluable. It will help to have more empathy with the client and make relevant suggestions down the line.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

For example, I got on a call last week with a lead that wanted to adapt their Shopify store for franchisees because they were planning on securing franchise agreements in the next 6 months. They wanted to have the same look and feel across all the franchises but the product selection and site content would be slightly different. The options were either to figure out a way to switch between these different environments on the same store or build separate stores for each franchise.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

The important context here was that the franchise owners would barely touch the site at all. Also the ‚Äúfranchises‚Äù were just different production centers. Some of the centers couldn‚Äôt create some of the products which necessitated this kind of product curation.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

This opened my mind to truly understand the problem and we are working now to find a solution using the same Shopify store.

Hey all üëã!

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Welcome back! This is my 4th and final edit of [i_only_speak_liquid](https://ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com/) - thanks for having me in your inbox for the past couple of months! I‚Äôm [Joe](https://www.storetasker.com/experts/joe-callon?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-44-being-clear-with-your-clients), a [Storetasker](https://resources.storetasker.com/become-an-expert?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-44-being-clear-with-your-clients) expert and front-end developer who has worked within Shopify‚Äôs Plus Support team, agencies, and as a freelancer for a good few years. For the final time, let‚Äôs go!

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I‚Äôve been putting some thought into how you can make your work stand out as a freelance developer in the Shopify space. Plenty of people offer similar services to you, often at a lower price, so what can you do to ensure the clients you want choose to work with you? One thing I‚Äôve found throughout my career working in agencies and with large enterprise clients, is that clear information is invaluable to them.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

This can be something as large as putting together a rigorous functional specification for the client‚Äôs new store or theme, or it can be as tiny as includinginfoelements within your schema for settings to let the client know what something does when they‚Äôre playing around with their lovely new site.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

This may sound silly, but something as small as this can help you stand out from a freelancer working for a small fee who is happy to cut corners and get the task out of the door. Whilst the work they produce may work in the present, their code and setup may be too confusing to change in the future, or the client just may entirely misunderstand what a setting or field is used for within their theme due to poor communication.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Just by adding some explainer text into your merchant‚Äôs theme editor, you‚Äôre keeping yourself in conversation with them long into the future as they continue to adapt your work as their business needs change, and this keeps at the front of their mind.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

They may add a section to their homepage and see the incredibly handy ‚ÄúThis setting does X‚Äù or ‚ÄúEnter Y here to do Z‚Äù text in the customiser. They remember how great you were to work with, and they‚Äôre more inclined to reach out to you again in the future as they‚Äôre reminded of the great experience and the way you thought about them holistically, and not just another task on a to-do list.

One thing about relying on yourself for work is that you should always expect clients to do the unexpected. They may hit you up for a project, spend time scoping with you, and then decide against it entirely, or you may find out they‚Äôve been shopping around for other quotes, thanks for your time, no hard feelings etc but you‚Äôre just that little too pricy for them right now!

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

This all comes with part of being a freelancer and learning not to take any knockbacks too harshly and as a personal affront to your business is hard, but it‚Äôs a key part of being successful. There‚Äôs no use in throwing more wasted time into something by worrying about it or agonising over how much thought you put into a project that didn‚Äôt work out. Take a breath, and move on to the next one.

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

It‚Äôs unlikely you‚Äôve missed [Shopify‚Äôs latest raft of announcements as part of their Editions series](https://www.shopify.com/editions/winter2024?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-43-shopify-editions-winter-2024), but if you have, your local reporter Joe is here to fix that.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

The biggest announcement came in the form of the updates to the product model Shopify uses, which will now let you list out individual colour variants as products (Plus-only, for now!) and create more rich categorisation. The main headline here though, is that the rollout has begun to allow up to 2000 variants per product - the 100 limit for this has been one of Shopify‚Äôs biggest bugbears since I started working on the platform, so this is amazing to finally see change. There‚Äôs also [support for swatches](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/online-store/themes/theme-structure/theme-settings?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-43-shopify-editions-winter-2024#options-with-swatches)!

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

In the world of discounts, free shipping can now be offered automatically and you can take a fixed amount off Buy X Get Y discounts. Shopify is also now finally offering out their first-party Bundles and Subscriptions apps to everyone, which is huge for anyone still relying on janky apps to power essential parts of their business model.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

For us developers, [there‚Äôs some really cool stuff here](https://www.shopify.com/editions/winter2024?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-43-shopify-editions-winter-2024#developer), including theme blocks, which let you pre-define blocks that can be used across sections so your clients don‚Äôt need to duplicate content across their store. This also means support for nesting blocks has been added, which while things might be getting a little confusing from a Liquid point of view, creates a much more robust system of managing content.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

These changes are in developer preview for now, but they work well and I can‚Äôt imagine it‚Äôll be too long before they‚Äôre pushed out everywhere.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Genuinely, there‚Äôs too much stuff to list in one email, so go check out the Editions page for yourself and then come back wowed and ready to read on for some wonderful recommendations!

When relying on yourself for work, you should always expect clients to do the unexpected. They may hit you up for a project, spend time scoping with you, and then decide against it entirely, or you may find out they‚Äôve been shopping around for other quotes: thanks for your time, no hard feelings etc but you‚Äôre just that little too pricy for them right now!

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

While you‚Äôre working for someone else, it‚Äôs all too easy to forget the sales process that comes before the tasks hit your deck, but as a freelancer you‚Äôre obviously in charge of this process, and it can be hard. There is definitely something to be said for the comfort in knowing bringing the work in simply isn‚Äôt your responsibility. It can feel like a failure to be told you didn‚Äôt make the cut by a client, but if you‚Äôre doing good work, the right clients will come to you in time.

Hey all üëã!

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Welcome back to my second edit of ‚Äòi_only_speak_liquid‚Äô to kick off 2024, hope your new year is going well so far! I‚Äôm [Joe](https://www.storetasker.com/experts/joe-callon?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-42-making-theme-previews-easy), a [Storetasker](https://resources.storetasker.com/become-an-expert?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-42-making-theme-previews-easy) expert and front-end developer who has worked within Shopify‚Äôs Plus Support team, agencies, and as a freelancer for a good few years. Let‚Äôs get going!

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

If you‚Äôre a front end developer within the Shopify space, you‚Äôre probably pretty used to sharing your work with your team or client by heading into the Shopify admin, clicking the three small dots and right-clicking the Preview link to grab the URL for the version of your client‚Äôs store with your latest changes. This works, but it feels clunky, and will only ever direct the recipient to the homepage of the store you‚Äôre working on.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Shopify‚Äôs theme preview bar is also buggy, and the .shopifypreview.com links it generates don‚Äôt send you to the exact URL they‚Äôre generated from, and don‚Äôt allow for checking out whilst browsing, which is all to say, it‚Äôs a pretty poor experience.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

To get around this, I‚Äôve added a bookmarklet in my Chrome bookmarks bar which when clicked, automatically copies the URL of the page you‚Äôre on and appends the Shopify theme ID parameter to the end, with the ID of the theme you‚Äôre currently previewing added.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

To do this, right-click in your bookmarks bar and click Add Page, you can name this whatever you like, I just have it as ‚ÄúPreview Theme‚Äù. Then in the URL field, add the following:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

javascript:(function()%7Bif(window.location.href.indexOf('%3F') > -1) %7B%0Anavigator.clipboard.writeText(window.location.href%2B'%26preview_theme_id%3D'%[2Bwindow.Shopify.theme.id](http://2Bwindow.Shopify.theme.id?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-42-making-theme-previews-easy))%3B%0A%7D else %7B%0Anavigator.clipboard.writeText(window.location.href%2B'%3Fpreview_theme_id%3D'%[2Bwindow.Shopify.theme.id](http://2Bwindow.Shopify.theme.id?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-42-making-theme-previews-easy))%3B%0A}})()%3B

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Now click save, and when you click the Preview Theme link while browsing a Shopify store, the URL will be automatically copied to your clipboard:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

‚Äò[https://domain.com/products/test?preview_theme_id=XXXXXXXXX](https://domain.com/products/test?preview_theme_id=XXXXXXXXX&utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-42-making-theme-previews-easy)‚Äô

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

This will handle any other parameters on there too, so if you‚Äôre browsing a specific variant or have any tracking parameters in your URL, it‚Äôll still work as expected:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

‚Äò[https://domain.com/products/test?variant=1234567890&preview_theme_id=XXXXXXXXX](https://domain.com/products/test?variant=1234567890&preview_theme_id=XXXXXXXXX&utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-42-making-theme-previews-easy)‚Äô

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

This allows you to share the URL of the exact page you‚Äôre working on with the theme ID, and ensures you don‚Äôt run into a scenario where your client has forgotten to click the preview link before taking a look at the page, and wondering where all your incredible work has gone.

However, they do great work with the app side of their agency and ESD is a really well designed, easy to use app for any of your clients who are looking to offer a student discount without partnering with a third-party system and losing a large chunk of the revenue to them.

### One learning as a freelancer:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

This week marks my first as a full-time Shopify freelancer! I‚Äôve been working with Storetasker alongside my full time job at a Plus agency (h/t to Radiant who I mentioned a mere paragraph ago) for a couple of years and steadily growing my portfolio as a freelancer, so I think my number one learning for this edit is patience.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I‚Äôve been doing this job (or at least, something very similar) for coming up to ten years, and once you see that the freedom of freelancing is available to you, it‚Äôs very tempting to jump in with both feet. But, I‚Äôd exercise caution, making sure to build a lasting relationship with your employer and freelance clients to set yourself up and making sure you‚Äôre fully ready before committing yourself to being out there on your own.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

After all, you‚Äôre not just going to be able to turn on your laptop on a Monday and have work there ready for you, you have to bring that work in yourself, and it‚Äôs worth asking yourself if it‚Äôs worth the added stress and effort. Get everything you can from the experience of being employed, and then only when you feel like you are in a prime position, go for it!

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Take the time to save financially, but also save yourself from taking on too much at once to rush your career, and trust me, you‚Äôll feel the benefits in the long run.

Hey all üëã!

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Welcome tomy 1st everedition of 'i_only_speak_liquid'. I‚Äôm [Joe](https://www.storetasker.com/experts/joe-callon?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-41-debugging-app-issues-in-shopify-themes), an expert on [Storetasker](https://resources.storetasker.com/become-an-expert?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-41-debugging-app-issues-in-shopify-themes) & a front-end developer. I have worked within Shopify‚Äôs Plus Support team, agencies, and as a freelancer for a good few years. I‚Äôm looking forward to sharing some of my findings with you lovely lot!

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Apps are an essential part of the Shopify ecosystem, but they can occasionally throw up unexpected behaviour in your theme, and they‚Äôre often hard to pin down as the culprit for any issues you might be facing, whether it‚Äôs a broken add to cart or just a visual bug you can‚Äôt quite figure out. Disabling each app embed within the theme editor can sometimes bring you joy, but app developers aren‚Äôt always as transparent about their integrations and it can lead you down a confusing path.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

This was an issue facing us within Shopify‚Äôs support team daily as merchants implemented apps over the top of complex themes, resulting in knock-on effects that could have a huge impact on the merchant‚Äôs sales and customer trust. Thankfully, the team found a solution for most scenarios (full credit to the Plus Front End team for the snippet of code!).

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Essentially this bit of Liquid deconstructs thecontent_for_headertag which contains the app scripts for your store, and removes any URLs you don‚Äôt want based on an index. Starting with 0 as your urls_to_remove variable will log all the app URLs into your console and remove them all from content_for_header, essentially disabling these apps from running. From here, you can narrow it down to the apps you suspect might be causing the problem, until you find the offending URL. You can grab the code [here](https://smalldev.tools/share-bin/zUEM1SXS?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-41-debugging-app-issues-in-shopify-themes), just add it above the tag within your theme.liquid file.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Word of warning:make sure this code isn‚Äôt included in any published themes, editing content_for_header isn‚Äôt supported by Shopify in any way and could have some unintended consequences, this is purely an investigative tool meant for testing themes only.

[HouseParty](https://housepartyapp.com/?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-41-debugging-app-issues-in-shopify-themes) - It‚Äôs nice to see app developers trying something new rather than rehashing the same old ideas:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

This app allows you to add an embedded customer forum to a store, which fosters a sense of community with customers and creates more brand loyalty in a way that feels genuine and useful.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

It works using Shopify‚Äôs customer records, so you‚Äôre not introducing another layer of account registration or management, which is ideal to keep things simple. The app itself is very nicely designed and works great from my testing!

### One learning as a freelancer:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Coming from a background of working in agencies, it can be overwhelming to be expected to handle all aspects of a piece of work, from conception to project management to the actual development, but I‚Äôve found the greatest weapon we hold as freelancers is setting clear boundaries with a client. When putting together the quote for a project, make sure your scope is water-tight and it‚Äôs clear, step by step, what you‚Äôll be doing as part of the agreed project and what you‚Äôre expecting from your client. This could be adding a numbered list of the steps you‚Äôll carry out within the quote, being verbose about things at this stage is key to ensuring everyone‚Äôs on the same page.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Providing this information not only helps you should the client begin to scope-creep (it happens to us all), but it also leaves the merchant clear on what to expect from you. This can massively reduce the anxiety that comes with handling a project solo, and if you‚Äôre ever feeling out of your depth, you have something to refer back to that outlines where you need to focus your attention next.

Hey all üëã!

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Welcome tomy 4th & finaledition of 'i_only_speak_liquid'. I‚Äôm [Luke](https://www.storetasker.com/experts/luke-walsh?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-40-going-headless-connecting-a-external-cms-contentful), an expert on [Storetasker](https://resources.storetasker.com/become-an-expert?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-40-going-headless-connecting-a-external-cms-contentful) and I love working on headless challenges within Shopify.In January, another fellow Storetasker expert / Shopify dev will be taking the pen for 4 fresh edits üôÇ

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I‚Äôve been thinking about what to write for my final newsletter for Storetasker and settled on the final piece of the puzzle - content management systems.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Shopify is getting better at being able to add custom data through metaobjects but it might still not be enough for some users. This is why a lot of headless stores will use an external service to manage their content outside of products and inventory.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

One popular service is [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-40-going-headless-connecting-a-external-cms-contentful) which is a paid for service, but I‚Äôve found it one of the nicest to work with. If you are looking for a free alternative have a look at [Strapi](https://strapi.io/?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-40-going-headless-connecting-a-external-cms-contentful) which you can self-host.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Setting up for Contentful

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

The first thing we need to do is set up our Contentful client in our Remix space.¬† This is done much like the storefront API for Shopify. We head into our server.ts file and we can put our new code below the init for the Shopify API. This is just a preference as it keeps the external services together.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

If we expand our Contentful function we can go into more detail around how it is set up.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

First we set up the url that we need to hit. This requires us to set some ENV variables. These will later be set in the Hydrogen channel inside the Shopify admin but for local testing you can put them in your .env file locally.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

We‚Äôve set up these two ENVs that we must use for the api to work.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID- the space in contentful you want to use.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN- the access token that you can generate in the Contentful admin which gives you permission to the instance.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

You could also set up something like CONTENTFUL_ENV so that you can target Contentful environments that you can set up in their UI which are useful for testing content or for having separate content tied to a staging site.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

If you wish to use this you can update the URL to be https://graphql.contentful.com/content/v1/spaces/${env.CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID}/environments/env/${env.CONTENTFUL_ENV}

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

The last thing we need to do before we can use it in our loader is to add the Contentful variable to the Remix context. This is inside the createRequestHandler and inside this is the¬† getLoadContext where we add our new variable. You‚Äôll find this in the same file, server.ts.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Now we‚Äôve done that we can finally use the Contentful API in our loaders.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

In our loader we just add the contentful parameter to our context deconstructing and from here we can use it to make a GraphQL call.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Say we have collection data inside Contenful then we can use our new api to call contentful and pass in our GraphQL query along with any variables.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

To give you a full example, our query might look like this. It‚Äôs nice to have your queries in their own files exported as const for organisation and code readability, but you can also write them directly in the query parameter if you like. Here‚Äôs an example of it as a const variable in another file.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Note: if we have a content modal called Collection, in Contetnful‚Äôs GraphQL, the collection is also a collection of ‚Äúcollections‚Äù so the schema is collectionCollection. To make it easier, you can install the GraphQL explorer app in your space to test queries etc.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Finally, once we have the data back from the api after awaiting the response we can just return it like usual using Remix‚Äôs json() method like so:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

It‚Äôs easy to set up and has decent customisation options for a developer to be able to tie into it.

### One learning as a freelancer:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Your time as a freelancer is important, so tracking how much you work on something should be important as well.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Whether you bill hourly or per project I still think it is useful to know how much time you‚Äôve spent on something. For this reason, I like to use an app called TopTracker.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

You install it on your machine, and it just counts time and you set a note for each ‚Äútimer‚Äù. It is not super complex or has 100 features, but uploads to the cloud, has some reporting and you can break down stuff by client and most important - it is free.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

How you use it is up to you but it is great to look back on a month and see how much you‚Äôve accomplished or use it for billing like I do. It can also be a great way of seeing time spent on the most profitable clients or vice-versa.

Welcome tomy 3rd!!edition of 'i_only_speak_liquid'. I‚Äôm [Luke](https://www.storetasker.com/experts/luke-walsh?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-39-going-headless-moving-api-calls-servside), an expert on [Storetasker](https://resources.storetasker.com/become-an-expert?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-39-going-headless-moving-api-calls-servside) and I love working on headless challenges within Shopify.In 2 weeks, I shall send my final newsie (üò¢) before handing the pen off to another expert. Enjoy!

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

We‚Äôve looked at some initial choices of headless apps and we‚Äôve also delved into some tips and common gotchas of the Shopify Hydrogen setup when using the documentation.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Now I thought it would be useful to look into how we‚Äôd move a client side api call into the server side.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Let‚Äôs also pretend that we are exposing an API secret too on the client before and how we can do it server side more safely (scary).

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

API Calls Hydrogen

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

In Hydrogen you can use the ‚Äúroutes'' folder to store your api calls. The approach follows the same routing mentioned in the Remix docs for the file or folder naming convention that is converted into a url.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Our example will be creating a folder (you can also just have a file too) that is called:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

api.hello-work - this would translate into mystore.com/api/hello-world

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Now inside this folder we create our TS file, called route.ts and inside here we can put a special function called action.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

It takes three parameters that we can use to get information about the request, params that are attached to the url and the context of our Remix application.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

From here we can then inside our action function look to make sure it is a post request and if not we can throw an error back to the client. You can change this to check for any request as needed.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Once we have our data, we can get our hello world api to do something with it and return a new response back to the user. Here‚Äôs a sample of a more complete action and I‚Äôll break it down below.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

First, as before we get our params from the action function using object deconstructing and do the same again on the context to get the session, storefront api and env.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Next we check if the request is a POST - then we exit out if it is not. Great to make sure we don‚Äôt let through requests we don‚Äôt want.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

If we are a POST request, we continue by grabbing our ENV variable. This could be an API Secret or anything you like.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

We then get the json from the request but if it was a formdata POST request, we could do the same but with a different method which I‚Äôve left in the example.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Finally we grab our param from the JSON called bar and this is set up in TypeScript on the data object so we know what to expect.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Once we have what we need, we return the response back to the client with a new data object using the json method which is a nice wrapper function. We pass two params, one called success so we know that we‚Äôve done what we need to and the other called data which in our example just has a string and appends our bar variable.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

This is just a basic example, but using this as a base you can do a whole number of things and all server side which is a lot more secure for your application. Of course client side api calls are still perfectly fine to use depending on the scenario.

As freelancers we can wear a lot of ‚Äúhats‚Äù from frontend, to backend and devops.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

This is more and more becoming apparent as frontend applications like Hydrogen are running more hybrid approaches with a server side and client side stack.

Hey all üëã!

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Welcome tomy 2nd!!edition of 'i_only_speak_liquid'. I‚Äôm [Luke](https://www.storetasker.com/experts/luke-walsh?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-38-hydrogen-tips), an expert on Storetasker and I love working on headless challenges within Shopify.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

In the [previous newsletter](https://ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com/p/speak-liquid-37-choosing-go-headless-hydrogen) I focused on comparing two different headless technologies paired up with two popular frontend frameworks (Hydrogen vs. Nuxt / Nacelle).I‚Äôll be authoring another 2 newsies before handing the pen off to another expert. Enjoy!

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Let‚Äôs dive a little further into Shopify‚Äôs Hydrogen and I can give you a handful of tips based on their setup documentation that will help you sidestep some common issues I‚Äôve found working with it in the past.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Tip 1 - Load your product information server side

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Use the server side loader to your advantage. Remix is built to make use of node‚Äôs server side rendering, so you can preload your API data on the server and then hydrate the rest of the application.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

In Remix, you do this via the loader function, which takes in some loader arguments such as page parameters, the node request object, the application context and more. You can use these to get a product from Shopify like so.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

This will run a request to the Shopify Storefront API, cache the response and we send it to the frontend as json in the return that can be used in the main React component how you wish.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Important to note, this method only ever runs on the server. So you don‚Äôt have access to some things you might be used to on the client side like the ‚Äúwindow‚Äù object etc. It‚Äôs a common gotcha when working on server side apps.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Tip 2 - Caching is your friend.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

My example is close to what is on the Shopify Hydrogen website but with one quite important change. Caching.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

You should cache your API requests so that multiple requests don‚Äôt actually hit the shopify server for the response but their cache store for that product.¬† There‚Äôs plenty of options and you can set them via helper methods like in the example which looks like this:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Or by manually passing in an object that accepts a couple of properties such as max age and the revalidation time.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Whatever you decide depends on your use case, but caching is better than not caching for anything that does not change often like product information etc.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Tip 3 - Defer your non critical information

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Now you are loading in your information and caching, you want to make sure that you only load the minimal amount of information on the server, otherwise you run the risk of making the user wait for everything to be ready before they see anything.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Remix uses a defer method and Await component so you can do this easily. Say we had some recommended products along with our main product. We change the ‚Äújson‚Äù method into the ‚Äúdefer‚Äù one like so.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Then we update our component to display the product information as soon as we have it, but we don‚Äôt show the recommended products until we get the resolve back from the promise.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

The Suspense component allows you to set up a fallback, this is usually a component that shows a loading skeleton etc. Inside it is the Await, this component takes in the promise that we pass from the defer method in our loader and once that resolves, we show the actual component. We pass in the data to the new component from the return of the Await component and it renders as normal.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

With this, we load the page quickly with the main product data, then we just show a loading state until Shopify comes back with the recommended products.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Using defer, you can load any non-critical data onto pages but it is not limited to Shopify. Third party apps and other data can also be loaded into the loader and deferred. This reduces the risk of slowing down your site because of slow response times from other parties which you have little control over.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Tip 4 - Only load your information once if you can

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

In some cases in the past I‚Äôve seen multiple requests to the Shopify API for the same information over and over because the API request is tied to the route params changing or the variant selection buttons.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

If you see this, or do it by accident (we‚Äôve all been there) then just think about how you can store the information, reuse it to save network requests and make things quicker.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

One example is to use a ‚ÄúState‚Äù store which in React is called a Context. By wrapping your product route in say a Product Context. You can set up a store for product information that is returned from the API.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Then set up your selected options in the context too. That way, rather than asking Shopify to return information based on the selected options from the API, you can just filter the product variant data you have and update the product page.

As the app I like is one of my own. I built this app as an alternative to the many ‚Äúpoints‚Äù based loyalty programs for a lot of my clients who wanted an easier to understand program.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

It offers a lot of similar functionality such as various reward types, VIP programs, integrations etc but I also wanted pricing to be fair and no lock away features behind expensive paywalls.

### One learning as a freelancer:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I‚Äôve learned that continuous iteration is better than trying to perfect something before releasing it.¬† We all get stuck in the mindset that something is not done until it works flawlessly, has every function we could ever think of, and is perfect for the end user.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

In reality this is never the case, we have time constraints and bugs will always happen no matter how good we are. For this reason, it is more important to continually improve and iterate on your code and coding practices.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

The small changes and improvements you make will compound interest down the line which is going to save you time in the future. Don‚Äôt try and make a whole website faster, choose a key area like a PDP and start there and then choose a particular area which might be loading slower and improve that first.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Build up these iterations and eventually the entire site will be faster and hopefully because you did it in stages, you improved, your code got better and you passed on each learning to the next piece of code.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Now you can go back and start on the first component‚Ä¶ good luck!

I‚Äôm [Luke](https://www.storetasker.com/experts/luke-walsh?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-37-choosing-to-go-headless-hydrogen-or-other), an expert on Storetasker and I love working on headless challenges within Shopify. As always - I‚Äôll be writing 4 editions before handing the pen off to another expert. Enjoy!

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Recently, I've been working with more and more clients that are looking to move their Shopify storefront to a ‚Äòheadless‚Äô frontend. If you are new to the term, it is a technique of separating the client side shop from Shopify and running another piece of technology. These are typically popular frontend frameworks React or VueJS.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I hear you ask ‚ÄúBut what one should I choose?‚Äù.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

It depends on what you are more proficient in and how much you still want to lean on Shopify.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Hydrogen, is Shopify‚Äôs internal homegrown headless setup that is based on React/Remix and can be integrated nicely into the Shopify admin as an additional Sales Channel.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Vue devs have a bit more setup needed as there‚Äôs no Hydrogen for Vue. This means we‚Äôll focus on a combo of Vue/NuxtJs and a third party company called Nacelle that helps connect the Shopify data into Nuxt.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Pros of Hydrogen

- It‚Äôs Shopify‚Äôs technology which means it should be the most supported inside their own ecosystem.
- It uses less moving parts than the Vue alternatives which means less to manage, upgrade and maintain.
- Set up and deploying is very easy to manage inside the admin and deployed through Oxygen another Shopify platform.
- It‚Äôs free to use (at the moment).

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Things to consider for Hydrogen

- It uses Remix as the base set up for SSR (Server side rendering) and can have a steep learning curve for devs if they are used to just Liquid.
- It‚Äôs still fairly new and a little undocumented so you‚Äôll need previous experience in React/Remix to really get it working.
- It might not make sense for smaller businesses as the additional control means a lot more extra dev time (good for us though)

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Pros of Nuxt / Nacelle

- Vue is seen as a bit easier for devs to learn (if you are using the options API) that breaks up the flow into more obvious chunks.
- Shopify data is indexed externally in Nacelle which means that your store has a bit more redundancy. Also caching is handled by Nacelle which is easier to set up compared to the Storefront API.
- More flexibility on builds and deployment. Not using Hydrogen means you have more control on who hosts your builds and how you build it

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Things to consider using Nuxt / Nacelle

- Nacelle is a paid for platform, so there is an additional cost to use the service.
- Additional services mean more to maintain - although Nacelle is managed serviced you will still have to do some bits.
- Like React, Nuxt is for server side rendering and can be a bit of a learning curve to manage the server side and client side pages.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

So there you have it, hopefully enough to get you started on your journey with headless apps and Shopify. There‚Äôs no right or wrong answer when it comes to choosing one framework over the other. Just go with the one you feel most comfortable with and paired up with your clients needs for the project.

Learning being the key word.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

We‚Äôve all chosen to be a freelancer for different reasons and sometimes I think we all try to be an ‚Äúexpert‚Äù in everything that the web has to offer. It‚Äôs okay to not know everything and to tell clients that you do not know off the top of your head and will let them know about a question they had etc after.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

This is also important to know when it comes to new tech like Hydrogen, React and Vue etc. We all started out somewhere and a lot of the time you‚Äôll learn a lot more getting stuck in but the key,super key partis, you have to put in the effort to learn and keep on learning.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I‚Äôve found the greatest improvement in my skills because my hobbies align a lot with what I work on. I love to tinker in linux servers; creating Docker containers and building my own commercial Shopify apps. All these hours spent outside of billable hours help when I come up against a new client and they want something new or different. It feels more familiar to be confident diving into new docs, planning a new strategy and making sure I feel comfortable that I can take on the project with any additional discovery needed.

Hey all üëã!

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Welcome to 'i_only_speak_liquid' by Storetasker, where active Shopify developers like me ([Billy](https://www.storetasker.com/experts/billy-noyes?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-36-hiding-products-from-search-results)) share the learnings we face daily. This is my 8th and final edition of ‚Äòi_only_speak_liquid‚Äô. Enjoy!

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

A common problem clients always raise to me is that they have products on their Shopify stores, that they like to have in place for features such as free gifts or upsells, and they do not want these items to be discoverable or indexed. This is especially the case if the item is free, since users could find this product and be able to purchase it without meeting the requirements.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Thankfully Shopify have thought of a great and simple way for merchants to be able to prevent this issue. It only takes a couple minutes to get setup and uses metafields, so most clients will be very familiar with the process and can easily manage it.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

You start by creating a new product Metafield with the Namespace 'seo' and key 'hidden‚Äô. The Metafield type should then be ‚ÄòNumber‚Äô, just like the example in the screenshot below. The client can then set the Metafield of each product that should be hidden to the value ‚Äò1‚Äô.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

By adding this Metafield, Shopify will automatically trigger a new robots metatag to be added to the product page which will ensure that bothnoindex‚Äôing andnofollow‚Äôing are in place - This essentially means that search engines will not index the product page and display it within the search results when a potential customer searches for the brand or products.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }
p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Whilst adding in custom Liquid code to a template is quite easy for a developer, this is a very helpful and useful feature that Shopify has automatically added, and is definitely something that is requested from me all the time.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

It‚Äôs also part of the ‚ÄòBuilt for Shopify‚Äô program which is great to see and assures your clients that the apps being added to their store are verified by Shopify.

The benefits of being a freelancer are amazing and allow you to be your own boss, which provides many benefits. However, one thing you quickly learn is the importance of self-discipline. Without a traditional office structure, it's easy to become distracted or procrastinate. That's why cultivating self-discipline is a vital skill for success.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

One of the most valuable lessons I've learnt is the mastery of self-discipline. Setting clear objectives, maintaining to-do lists, and establishing a structured routine can make a world of difference. These strategies help you stay focused and productive, ensuring you meet project deadlines and consistently deliver high-quality work.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

The benefits of this self-discipline are far-reaching. Not only does it guarantee client satisfaction and the completion of tasks, but it also helps maintain a healthy work-life balance. Over time, as you refine your self-discipline, you'll find that your freelancing career becomes more rewarding and less stressful. Clients appreciate reliability and trustworthiness, often leading to repeat business and referrals.

Hey all üëã!

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Welcome to 'i_only_speak_liquid' by Storetasker, where active Shopify developers like me ([Billy](https://www.storetasker.com/experts/billy-noyes?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-35-re-orderable-metaobjects)) share the learnings we face daily. This is my 7th edition of ‚Äòi_only_speak_liquid‚Äô. Enjoy!

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Recently, I have been working on a custom collection page which required the client to be able to create a list of filters, the main label for these filters and also control the order.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Usually this could have been controlled through something like a comma separated list as a theme setting, for example:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

colours:shopify_colours, category:shopify_product_type, size:shopify_size, price: shopify_price

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Whilst this method definitely meets all of the requirements needed by the client and would allow me to build the filters in Liquid, it is not the most client friendly or very manageable. If the client accidentally forgets to use a comma or does not add the label before the filter, it starts to break the code.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Since Metaobjects have been released by Shopify, I am constantly finding out about the many use cases for them and how powerful they really are. I have since stopped using lists like the comma separated one above and have made the switch to using Metaobjects instead.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

One issue that I have had is how you can reorder Metaobject entries and give the client control over the order. I‚Äôve recently been shown a really good way of handling this and definitely think it will be useful for many other developers.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

You start by creating a new Metaobject, this will be used for the individual entries, for example this will be for the actual filter itself - for my specific usecase all I needed was the label and the value.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

You then create another new Metaobject, which will be used for the list and can be achieved by adding a field with the type Metaobject and choosing ‚ÄòList of entries‚Äô. This will allow you to then add all of your filters to the filter list and the client can reorder them as needed.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

One issue I have found with Metaobjects is that sometimes specific types can result in confusing code, it can also be difficult to loop through certain pieces of data and return the code in JSON format.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Below you can see how I was able to loop through the Filter List and create a global variable that I can then use within my Javascript code to access all of the set filter labels and values by the client.

### One app I like:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I have used Nosto quite a few times on different projects and have been able to take advantage of the powerful product recommendations it offers. Whether you need category metchandising based on shopper behaviour, product bundles, the ability to segment your shoppers based on their actions, or personalise content based on that individual user. The app provides a whole host of extremely powerful features - It even has the ability to A/B test to improve product recommendations and conversions.

### One learning as a freelancer:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

When you first get started as a freelancer, it can be really hard to believe in yourself and truly see the value that you can provide. Whilst this is definitely something that does come with time and experience, I definitely think it‚Äôs an issue we can all run into from time to time and suffer from imposter syndrome.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

One thing I have learnt is to be confident with the work you produce, clients are often coming to you because of the great projects they have seen of yours online and usually have a lot more belief in you, than you may have even in yourself.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Over time you will start to see the expertise you offer, become more confident and this will in-turn generate more leads.[Billy](https://www.storetasker.com/experts/billy-noyes?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-35-re-orderable-metaobjects) ([linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/billynoyes/?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-35-re-orderable-metaobjects))"

Hey all üëã!

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Welcome to 'i_only_speak_liquid' by Storetasker, where active Shopify developers like me ([Billy](https://www.storetasker.com/experts/billy-noyes?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-34-section-index)) share the learnings we face daily. This is my 6th edition of ‚Äòi_only_speak_liquid‚Äô. Enjoy!

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

On the 18th September I saw an update on Shopify‚Äôs developer changelogs that I have been looking forward to for a very long time. As part of a performance update, Shopify have created the newindexproperty which can be used to return the position of a section within it‚Äôs location.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

If you are using theimage_tagfilter, lazyloading will now automatically be applied for any section after the first three. This means that you won‚Äôt have to update any of the code and your clients will be benefiting from this update already.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

However, if you need more control, Shopify also have you covered. You can now usesection.indexand the 0-based index versionsection.index0to return the position within the location.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

This position number can then be used within your code to add conditions which will help benefit performance. For example, if you wanted an image to either be loaded lazily or eagerly.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Another solution that I‚Äôve recently used in a project and really works well with the concept of sections everywhere, is using thesection.indexto determine whether the section heading should be ah1tag or an alternative HTML tag. Previously, I would have to create a section setting that allows the client to choose, but often clients may not be aware of which type of tag they need to actually choose or this can simply get missed.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Shopify have released a full blog post about this update and you read more about it[here](https://performance.shopify.com/blogs/blog/announcing-new-liquid-features-for-better-web-performance?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-34-section-index).

If you read my previous post about[enrichiching your navigation](https://ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com/p/speak-liquid-28-enrich-navigation), you‚Äôll know that I love the Shopify app Mechanic and the features it provides. I recently found another great app made by the same team and it allows you to lock parts of your site unless the customer meets the specific requirements.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

For example you can hide a range of different parts of your site, such as products, collections, prices or even variants. These can then be shown for customers based on their tags, location or even specific passcodes.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I have built similar features many times for clients using custom JavaScript but this app is definitely a nice alternative and provides more features out of the box. It also developer friendly with its Liquid and API.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

The app also has the newBuilt for Shopifytag so you know that it is built very well and meets Shopify‚Äôs highest quality standards.

One thing I‚Äôve recently been doing to try to manage my time more effectively is time blocking, whilst I know this is a topic that is discussed all across the internet, I was yet to really dedicate myself to it and see if I would benefit from it. Over the short time I have been trying it out, I have definitely seen some benefits.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I‚Äôve been able to create a better balance between focus periods of work and having breaks which give me a chance to refresh. Time blocking has also mean that I can juggle the many clients and projects I do a lot more effectively. Sometimes it can be hard knowing when you need to switch to a different task but having this written down and specific time available has made it a lot easier.[Billy](https://www.storetasker.com/experts/billy-noyes?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-34-section-index) ([linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/billynoyes/?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-34-section-index))"
"""i only speak liquid"" #33: Minify CSS with Liquid",Written by Billy (a Storetasker Expert),,,https://ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com/p/speak-liquid-33-minify-css-liquid,"p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Hey all üëã!

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Welcome to 'i_only_speak_liquid' by Storetasker, where active Shopify developers like me ([Billy](https://www.storetasker.com/experts/billy-noyes?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-33-minify-css-with-liquid)) share the learnings we face daily. This is my 5th edition of ‚Äòi_only_speak_liquid‚Äô. Enjoy!

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

As developers, we are often taking on projects that have been previously built and require us to implement new functionality. One common issue I hear from most clients is their site is quite slow or scoring low on Google‚Äôs Lighthouse.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Whilst it would be great if we could always have complete control over how a theme has been built, it is not always possible to completely rewrite code and sometimes the budget a client has does not allow for much time to be spent improving and optimising their site.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I wanted to share one cool trick I found quite a while back. It uses Liquid to minify the CSS code, by removing unnecessary characters, comments, extra spaces and newlines. This helps to reduce the file size and improve the time it takes to fetch the stylesheet.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

The Liquid code below can be used to wrap the client‚Äôs already existing CSS inside of thecapture. It then strips and replaces parts of the CSS to minify it.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

The Liquid code below can be added to the Liquid stylesheet, e.g. theme.scss.liquid. The already existing css should be wrapped inside of thecapture. The CSS will then be formatted to strip and replace specific parts to create the newly minified version.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

- Free iconsI‚Äôm always spending time searching for icons for clients and this site definitely helps reduce that time since it has a huge library of free icons
- Shopify Theme ConsoleShopify CLI now has REPL (read-eval-print loop) tool for testing out Liquid, it‚Äôs very cool to see that they have implemented this and I‚Äôm sure many will find it very helpful
- RunJS AppI‚Äôve also recently found RunJS which is a very nice way to play around and test out new ideas in a JavaScript environment. Of course you could just use Node.JS or an online tool like JSFiddle, but they definitely don‚Äôt look as nice

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I have used quite a few different apps to power search and collection pages in the past, whether this be restyling the pre-built options or even building them completely from scratch. Recently, I have been using[Algolia](https://apps.shopify.com/algolia-search?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-33-minify-css-with-liquid)to power a new collection page that I am working on and it has definitely been one of the nicest experiences. I‚Äôm currently building a new site with Vue and the Algolia Vue components they provide have made the whole experience very simple. It provides you with pre-built components that you can also override using Vue Slots.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

The app might not be for every client because of it‚Äôs cost but I definitely have enjoyed building with Algolia and would love to work on more projects in the future that use it.

Sometimes it can be easy to forget about freelancers that are at the beginning of their career and are having a hard time finding new clients. I get a lot of messages on LinkedIn about this so I wanted to share a couple ways I‚Äôve been able to meet new clients.

- Share your workNobody is going to know what you are capable of if you don‚Äôt show them. Posting your work, or even ideas, on social media is one of the best ways to show potential clients that you have a very good understanding of Shopify and web development. They‚Äôre able to look through your posts
- Offer your help for freeWhilst I definitely think everyone deserves to be paid for the effort and time they put into their work, it can be hard to gain the trust of clients who are wanting to find developers to work on their sites.Many people now have online businesses, even if they have a small side hustle, this can be a very good opportunity to ask if they need help. Sometimes they‚Äôll just need advice on setting up the smallest of features. You can then use this as an opportunity to showcase your skills and impress them. Once you‚Äôve completed the initial task, ask them if they have any other ideas in their roadmap or any goals they want to achieve, then see if you can help them achieve these for a fee.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

If you have any other useful tips like these, I‚Äôd love to hear them and my LinkedIn messages are always open so definitely reach out![Billy](https://www.storetasker.com/experts/billy-noyes?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-33-minify-css-with-liquid) ([linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/billynoyes/?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-33-minify-css-with-liquid))"

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Shopify theme development is an ever-evolving field, but sometimes, the simplest things can make a significant difference. While we often use JavaScript events and Liquid objects, not all of us dig deep into the toolbox. So today, let's talk about leveraging Shopify's built-in features to improve the Shopify Theme Editor experience, particularly when building custom sections for clients.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

The Theme Editor generates specific JavaScript events for both sections and blocks. These events bubble up and can be quite handy. For instance, you've got events likeshopify:sectionorshopify:blockwhich can be useful in many scenarios.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Imagine you want to develop a popup section in a theme, where each popup is a block. If you're letting merchants customize these popups, you'd want to make sure the merchant sees the changes in real-time. That's where theshopify:block:selectevent comes in. You can use it to show the popup as they tweak it. A simple JavaScript snippet can make this happen:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

This is just scratching the surface; you can do a lot more to enhance user experience in a clean, effective manner.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Oh, and let's not forget the Liquid objects like request.design_mode and request.visual_preview_mode. These are super helpful for modifying the behavior of JavaScript elements depending on whether you're in the Theme Editor or just previewing your work.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

You can find all the events and objects [here](https://shopify.dev/docs/themes/architecture/sections/integrate-sections-with-the-theme-editor?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-32-shopify-theme-editor-tricks-tools#javascript-events).

- AI in the Help Center. Although Sidekick isn‚Äôt available for everyone yet, the revamped Shopify Help Center now has an AI chat feature. In my experience, it's pretty good at clearing up any confusions you might have.
- Change the primary market of your store. Starting October 1st, Shopify will allow merchants to set their primary market in any currency, regardless of their shop currency. Super useful and claimed feature!

### One app I like:

Organization isn't just a buzzword‚Äîit's the bedrock of a successful freelance career and a balanced life. Let's cut to the chase; here are some game-changing tools that help me stay on point:

- ClickUp: If you‚Äôre tired of jumping between project management apps, give ClickUp a whirl. What sets it apart is its customization. I organize my workflow by client folders and task lists, but the Workload view on their premium plan is the real gem. It‚Äôs like having a project manager in your pocket.
- Loom: Skip the endless client meetings and send quick video updates or demos instead. It's a game-changer for showing clients how to test new developments.
- Tango: Think of it as Loom for written and image-based tutorials. Just hit 'record' on the Chrome extension, walk through the steps, and voil√†! You‚Äôve created an easily-shareable guide in minutes.
- Toggl: It integrates flawlessly with ClickUp and helps me ensure I‚Äôm not overshooting client hours. Plus, the quarterly reports are a treasure trove of insights into where my time actually goes.

Hey all üëã!

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Welcome to 'i_only_speak_liquid' by Storetasker, where active Shopify developers like me (Robert) share the learnings we face daily.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

PS: I've been focusing my efforts on building my Shopify app called[Orbe](https://shop.orbe.app?utm_source=i_only_speak_liquid&utm_medium=news&utm_campaign=29). Our mission is to make selling globally easier on Shopify Markets. I am also a developer on Storetasker.

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

The purpose of a collection is to guide customers to find the products they desire effortlessly. One common practice, especially in fashion brands, is to present collections like a magazine, showcasing products with inspirational images that allow customers to visualize and be enticed to purchase.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

This feature can be found in many Shopify themes. Still, we'll explore how to create it in a collection grid section on a Shopify theme, adding a magazine-style aesthetic to the collection.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Start by locating the collection section where the product array is rendered with the product card:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Next, build a simple schema for our block within this collection grid section to add an image with a link:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Thepositionnumber input serves as a comparator to insert this block after a specific loop index in the product array within the collection.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Moving back to the rendering of each product card, calculate the position of the loop by creating a variable:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

forloop.index0provides the current iteration index, and paginate.current_offset reflects the total number of items on previous pages, ensuring content insertion in the right place even through pagination.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Now compare the index with the position to insert the block and render it if matched:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

The final code looks like this:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

This example is simple but leaves room for enhancements. You can add videos, text, or other content to create a customizable magazine collection within the theme editor.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

For an added touch, you could allow the merchant to customize the column size using additional inputs and CSS grid or flex classes.

- Shopify Editions new features explained. Ed Codes channel explain so well in this video some quick tutorials on the latest Shopify features that were released in July 2023 in the Shopify Summer Editions.
- Using Python in Notebooks. ShopifyQL Notebooks now supports the ability to incorporate Python code blocks into existing and new Notebooks. This will allow you to retrieve data, combine it, and visualize it within Notebooks.
- Remix & App Development. Remix has now become the recommended method for building apps on Shopify, sparking some controversy within the developer community. Shopify now endorses Remix as the go-to stack for app development.

### One app I like:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

[Store Watcher](https://platform.shoffi.app/r/rl_Pk3wC46x?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-31-magazine-collections-and-summer-break)

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Store Watcher is an indispensable tool I recommend to any Shopify developer working with merchants. This all-in-one app is specifically designed to make sure your store is running properly and enables you to be notified instantly if there's an issue.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

It allows you to create tests that can run at specific times to monitor various store functionalities like customer login, product searches, the add-to-cart button, and more. You can even use custom tests unique to your store, employing either the browser extension or pre-built tests.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

We've been using Store Watcher for several clients, and it's truly been a game-changer. It helps detect major issues before your customers encounter them, giving both developers and merchants peace of mind. Merchants often upgrade their subscription once they realize the benefits it brings.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

One of my favourite features is the email notification. If something doesn't work as expected, you can set up the system to receive a timely alert on your end.

### One learning as a freelancer:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

The hustle of freelancing can sometimes overshadow the world beyond our screens. It's a path filled with both exhilaration and challenges and finding that delicate balance between life and work isn't always easy.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

As projects mount and deadlines loom, the idea of taking a break can feel like an unattainable luxury. Yet, I reflect on the necessity of disconnecting, especially at this time of the year.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Despite knowing this, there are moments when I need to remind myself to pause, breathe, and step outside my professional life. Holidays, short trips, or even brief moments away from the screen can generate renewal and inspiration.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

So disconnect from clients, pending tasks and even this newsletter. Enjoy your summer holidays!

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Last week was nothing short of a rollercoaster for the entire Shopify ecosystem. If, for some odd reason, you missed out on the action, Shopify rolled out its most recent product updates. There's a multitude of new features waiting to be explored at [Shopify Editions Summer 23](https://www.shopify.com/editions/summer2023?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-30-hidden-shopify-updates).

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

In this week's issue, I'm focusing on some overlooked yet potent releases. They might not create much buzz, but they're cool improvements for making developers‚Äô lives easier.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

The first one that caught my eye is the new filtering capabilities within the Shopify Search & Discovery app. It now allows you to group filter values under a single name. This elegantly solves a longstanding issue for merchants with specific colour variations for each item, such as Light Blue or Navy. Customers browsing a collection page and opting for a ""Blue"" filter will see both colour variants.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Before this update, the workaround involved creating a variant metafield to instruct Shopify's filter how it should group colours. In fact, I made a[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek5QagJ6q_w&utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-30-hidden-shopify-updates) a while back explaining how to achieve this.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Thankfully, you can now group colours effortlessly through the Search & Discovery app:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

In our last issue, we explored development improvements for B2B stores, more specifically, crafting product forms that allow B2B customers to add multiple variants simultaneously.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Shopify announced that developers can create templates exclusively for B2B customers within the Theme Editor. This means you can create a product form section that merchants can exclusively add to their B2B user templates (remember that this feature is only available to Shopify Plus merchants).

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Furthermore, you can utilize liquid objects like [quantity_rule](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/liquid/objects/quantity_rule?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-30-hidden-shopify-updates) to enhance frontend behaviour based on merchant settings in their Shopify B2B experience:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

It's truly heartening to see the platform evolving, making it increasingly straightforward to design and develop responsive and efficient storefronts on Shopify.

### 3 links you can‚Äôt miss:

- Flex Sections: Although it's not officially released yet, Shopify is gearing up to enable Flexbox section development. This update promises a far more customizable experience for merchants within the Theme Editor. From what I've seen, it looks spectacular!
- New Shopify Metaobjects Pages: Dive into this insightful video to understand the novel approach of building pages. It offers a wealth of ideas that you could potentially implement for your clients.
- Extension-Only Apps: As the name suggests, extension-only apps are custom apps devoid of embedded app pages; they're composed entirely of extensions. This offers a more streamlined way of developing custom apps for clients, as extension-only apps can be hosted directly on Shopify and don‚Äôt require dashboards.

### One app I like:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

[ShopQuiz](https://admin.revenuehunt.com/s/mushdesk?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-30-hidden-shopify-updates)by RevenueHunt

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

ShopQuiz is my go-to app when merchants express their interest in creating quizzes to guide their customers. It's been embraced by some of the best Shopify stores I've come across, and it's easy to see why. The user interface is intuitive and easy to understand, making the setup process a breeze.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

You can create super advanced quizzes that will recommend the best product choice for customers and seamlessly send captured leads to your mailing list or CRM. This gives you the power to leverage customer data and create higher ROI marketing campaigns.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Speaking of setup, the support team at RevenueHunt truly goes above and beyond. They're always ready to assist in tailoring the app to meet your client's specific needs. Their friendliness and willingness to help make the whole process smoother and more efficient.

### One learning as a freelancer:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I've had numerous instances where merchants hired developers to find the optimal solution to a problem. Surprisingly, many times the solution lay not in developing a frontend feature or implementing an existing one but in integrating with a third-party solution on the App Store or that integrates as an app on Shopify.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

In these scenarios, what's happening is that the merchants are hiring you not just for your technical expertise but for your consulting prowess. While business consultancy is quite common, the value brought by a developer in technology consulting is often overlooked. As tech consultants, we offer a unique combination of technical know-how and a deep understanding of the Shopify platform and its ecosystem.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

So, how do we appropriately value this kind of consultancy work? The key lies in the communication and structuring of the project. It's crucial to explain to the merchant upfront that the project will begin with a technology consultancy phase, priced accordingly. In this phase, you will do research, engage in discussions with different solution providers, and delve deeply into the scope of the problem the merchant is trying to solve. However, it's important to clarify that this phase does not guarantee the implementation of a solution or a 100% resolution of the problem in the way they initially thought.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Following the consultancy phase, once a solution is identified, a separate project task can be set up to implement or develop the final solution. This approach helps you allocate your time and resources better and allows your clients to understand the value you provide as a technology consultant in addition to your role as a developer.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Being a freelancer is not just about developing code. It's about adding value through your expertise, and that's something we should always remember to put forward.

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

As you may know, Shopify recently launched its [B2B feature for Shopify Plus](https://www.shopify.com/uk/plus/solutions/b2b-ecommerce?_bt=432364377578&_bk=shopify+b2b&_bm=b&_bn=g&_bg=104649519291&=&ds_rl=1287001&gclid=CjwKCAjw5MOlBhBTEiwAAJ8e1udxo2927l0yuKIeTymvGnWhLUurwB4eVWeCiENp3t8ZtoBvgKh9PhoCqcwQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds&utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-29-b2b-customizations-continuous-learning) accounts, bringing native B2B capabilities to the platform. However, it's important to note that B2B selling on Shopify was already possible through various fantastic apps available in the ecosystem.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

While the new native B2B feature comes with exciting APIs and functionalities, merchants often find the need to customize their storefronts when venturing into B2B selling. Here are a couple of examples:

- Streamlining the cart experience: Business customers typically purchase in larger quantities than individual consumers. It's beneficial to display variants grouped per product to optimise the cart page and drawer drawer rather than listing each variant as a separate line. This approach prevents an overly cluttered cart when dealing with multiple quantities.
- Enhancing the product page: For a smoother user experience, it's ideal to provide a way for businesses to add multiple variants at once. Implementing a quantity picker for each variant allows them to input desired quantities quickly. Some merchants have achieved this by developing a popup interface resembling an Excel sheet that appears when clicking buttons like ""Add to cart"" or ""Select quantities.""

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

While these tasks may seem straightforward, they require JavaScript and Liquid workarounds. Let's see some code snippets that demonstrate how to implement the quantity picker on the product page.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

First, in the Liquid part of the code, a loop iterates over each product variant, generating a quantity picker interface for each variant.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

In the JavaScript part of the code, an event listener is set up to handle click events on elements with the class ""add_to_cart."" When clicked, the script collects the selected variant IDs and quantities and sends a POST request to the Shopify cart endpoint to add the items to the cart.

### 3 links you can‚Äôt miss:

- Simplified extension versioning and deployment.Coming soon, you'll be able to release all your extensions simultaneously, directly from Shopify CLI. This is huge for all Shopify app devs, as it‚Äôs a waste of time.
- New Figma Developer Tools. Figma has released great features to help developers interact and understand the design to develop. If you use Figma with your clients, take the time to understand all the new features and let us know to designers.
- Storefront API is now available to non-channel apps.In case you miss it, Storefront API is now available for any app. This allows developers to create faster apps that are compatible with Shopify Markets or better interact with the storefront.

### One app I like:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

[ReturnGO](https://returngo.ai/shopify-app/?ref=mushdeskteam&utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-29-b2b-customizations-continuous-learning)

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

ReturnGO is a one-stop solution for post-purchase management, automating everything from order tracking to returns and exchanges.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

After working with several return apps, ReturnGO is the best product out there in the App Store. It helps provide customers with a branded, self-service return portal that makes it easy for them to initiate returns and exchanges. They‚Äôre even integrated with the most common solutions in any country and are super open to integrating with more local warehouses and carriers. If your clients want a return management solution, trust ReturnGO as your partner.

### One learning as a freelancer:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I've learned that continuous learning is crucial as a freelancer. In the rapidly evolving world of technology, staying up-to-date is essential.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Especially with the rise of AI-powered tools like[Shopify Sidekick](https://twitter.com/tobi/status/1679114154756669441?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-29-b2b-customizations-continuous-learning), these advancements are transforming how we work and highlighting the importance of honing our skills to provide exceptional client value.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Tools like Sidekick exemplify how AI can automate tasks and provide valuable insights, freeing time to focus on more strategic and high-value activities. As a freelancer, this underscores the significance of staying ahead of the curve and embracing new technologies to remain competitive.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

While the demand for Shopify expertise is promising, it's important not to become complacent. Technology trends change quickly, and it's vital to avoid stagnation.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

As AI advances, embracing new technologies and expanding your skill set will be pivotal in delivering exceptional results. Clients increasingly value freelancers who can harness the power of AI to drive innovation, improve efficiency, and provide strategic guidance.

## What I've been thinking about

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Over on my[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/billynoyes/?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-28-enrich-your-navigation), I‚Äôm always sharing recent projects I‚Äôve worked on and providing a brief technical breakdown of how I build certain things. If you read my[1st I only Speak Liquid post](https://ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com/p/speak-liquid-25-thinking-terms-sections-blocks)you‚Äôll know that I always try to build without apps where possible and naturally I get a lot of questions about how I‚Äôm able to add in specific content to areas that are really limited.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

One of the areas that I feel is most limited on Shopify is thenavigation setup. Besides from the fact that we still haven‚Äôt got a way to import/export navigations in 2023‚Ä¶ There isn‚Äôt really a built-in Shopify way of adding the typical features you‚Äôd see across most e-commerce sites to your navigation and I‚Äôve been able to find some useful ways of getting around these limitations.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Using the Navigation Link Titles

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

One technique I use often is to add the additional content with the navigation link titles, for example in the screenshot below you can see how I was able to use square brackets to add in an extra title that would get displayed above the main titles.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Using the[split filter](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/liquid/filters/split?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-28-enrich-your-navigation)you can split each navigation title to separate the two pieces of text and display them in the correct place. You can see below how I was able to use this feature to create the main navigation in the header with some additional subheading titles above each link.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }
p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

This exact same technique can also be used to created featured links which could be a different colour or bold, for example you could include[FEATURED]in the link title. Through adding in a[replace filter](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/liquid/filters/replace?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-28-enrich-your-navigation)you can ensure that this text is never actually shown to the customer on the frontend and then you could use an if statement to see if the link title contains that featured tag and apply a different classname to update the styling.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I‚Äôve also used this before to allow the client to add in SVG icons and be able to update them whenever they want, for example they could include[ICON-STAR]in the link title and then you‚Äôd be able to render that specific icon within the navigation. I‚Äôll usually provide the client with a list of all their icon names so they have full choice and because I always create a snippet with all their icons inside, it‚Äôs very easy to just pass the icon name that‚Äôs extra from the navigation into the snippet.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Using Section Blocks

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Another really useful technique I use is to create new blocks, this works really well for areas like the meganav dropdowns where you might need to add a featured image or a featured set of extra links.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

You can implement this by creating a new block type for a section, for example it could be afeatured_imagewhich has an image picker, title and link. You would then also need to add a text setting that allows the client to enter the top level link that the featured image would sit under, in the code you‚Äôd then be able to use this to match up the specific meganav dropdown with the toplevel link and display the image.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I‚Äôve actually recently used this exact method for a client that wanted to add in custom badges and have control over the text that is displayed, as well as the background and text colour.

I think one of the biggest issues I face is not knowing when to take a break and from speaking to a lot of other creatives I know this is a very common problem. Everytime I do take a break I come back a lot more motivated and the time away from the keyboard usually helps me think of new ideas, even if it‚Äôs how to reapproach a technical problem and solve the issue.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I definitely haven‚Äôt completely figured this out though and I have a lot of work to do here, but it‚Äôs definitely a good thing to be aware of and know that you‚Äôre work will actually benefit a lot from the break.

## What I've been thinking about

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }
p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

At the end of my[last post](https://ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com/p/speak-liquid-26-css-marquees)I mentioned that my next post would be about how impactful the decisions we make as developers can be for our clients and their business.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

When I first transitioned to being a Shopify developer I had to adjust my mindset from seeing my clients as ‚Äòcustomers‚Äô, to seeing them as business owners, representing themselves in front of thousands of customers

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Here are my main tips to adopt a ‚Äòbusiness owner mindset‚Äô when dealing with your clients:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }
p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Test Your Work

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Test our work is a given (features, bug fixes etc). But I‚Äôm talking more specifically about testing the impact of your work with tools such as Google‚Äôs Lighthouse. Learning about site speed, accessibility and SEO helps you not only solve problems but without ever harming your clients‚Äô business.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

The benefit to highlighting the impact of your work on things like Site Speed also generally opens up more conversations for additional work.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }
p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Stop Hard Coding

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Something that I see happen all too often is developers' hard coding values. Even just before writing this post, I was working on a project to update some icons that the previous developer had hard coded using the image file‚Äôs CDN URL. The client was paying different developers each time they wanted a new icon to be displayed. The client just believed this was the way it worked.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

If you happened to read my[first post](https://ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com/p/speak-liquid-25-thinking-terms-sections-blocks)you‚Äôd recall me saying how powerful sections and blocks can be, and in this particular situation it was no different. I was able to create a new block type for the section, which allows the client to upload images and use them as the icons.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

When I explained the issue with the original hard coded solution and the updates I had put in place to the client, they were so happy to hear that this problem was finally resolved once and for all. They were so happy that they actually decided to send over a much longer list of additional work. Whilst I definitely spent a bit of extra time updating the icons to use blocks instead of just adding the URL in the code, that little bit of extra investment of my time actually benefited me greatly.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I also see a lot of text being hard coded into themes, even despite locales and theme/section settings being so easy to set up - This is a really quick change that prevents further issues in the future.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }
p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Clean Code

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Recently I was asked by a client to help them get ready for launch. It was a completely custom theme that had been built on top of Dawn and immediately the client expressed that they were worried the code was bad.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

When I started getting into the project, some of the more complex code was really hard to understand and even the developer that wrote it was having a lot of problems understanding it. This took extra time to understand the code, and even more time to rewrite it.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Each piece of code is different and writing clean code is a whole skillset on its own, however I wanted to share some common problems that I see all the time and can be fixed really easily to improve the development experience for everyone involved:

- Having lines of code that are really long make it nearly impossible to read, If a HTML tag is starting to get too long, separate the attributes and even the attribute values onto new lines
- Don‚Äôt be afraid to create new variables, not only will this reduce repetition but also give some context on what that particular value is
- A common thing that‚Äôs always mentioned, but definitely something very important is good comments because even you will come back to code you wrote and completely forget what it does
- Get rid of commented code! If the code was needed, it probably wouldn‚Äôt be commented out. If you‚Äôre using version control for development, you could just put this code on another branch for future reference

It‚Äôs a great incentive that merchants can advertise on their sites, which will likely help to increase sales and lead to more trees being planted!

## One learning as a freelancer

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Sometimes it can be hard as a developer when you find an issue with the current solution a client is using but you‚Äôre maybe not being paid for that additional time to provide an alternative solution that works better.. As I mentioned with the example above about the icons and fixing the hard coding, delivering solutions above the clients‚Äô expectations can be really impressive and help build trust with your clients.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Of course each client is different and it might not be the right thing for certain situations, however it‚Äôs a great way to show the level of service you provide and can lead to more work.

## What I've been thinking about

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

In the past I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve needed to build a section that automatically moves content from one side to another, you then probably looked for a solution and found the HTML tag, only to see that it has been deprecated.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Marquees can look quite complex to a lot of developers and you may even feel the need to use a library or app, however continuing from my previous[i only speak liquid](https://ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com/p/speak-liquid-25-thinking-terms-sections-blocks)[post](https://ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com/p/speak-liquid-25-thinking-terms-sections-blocks), where I broke down how you can slowly move away from using some apps and begin building out features, I‚Äôm going to break down a really simple solution that I‚Äôve been asked about many times before - There‚Äôs even a few bonus customisations if you make it to the end of the article!

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

So we‚Äôll start off with the basic Shopify Section setup

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

We‚Äôre then going to need a way of adding in the text to display within the marquee as it scrolls. I like to build sections as customisable as possible for clients, so I‚Äôll create these as blocks with a text setting so that the client can add as many or as little as they need.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

We can then loop through each of these blocks and display the text. On a side note it‚Äôs always good practice to add in a check to make sure that there is actually a value set for a specific setting before trying to display all of it‚Äôs HTML content. It‚Äôs easy to accidentally add a new block to a section and I see this all the time, even on live sites. If this check isn‚Äôt there, then it can mean that the HTML is displayed without the content and things start to break, for example imagine a carousel with a missing image but still having all the slide code in place.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

The most common question I get when I show other developers this marquee section is how do you make sure that there is no gap at the end of the animation, this would completely ruin the effect if each time the content got to one side it completely just stopped and then reset. So to prevent this I use an additional for loop that will duplicate the content to give the effect that it seamlessly just keeps scrolling across.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

At the moment it probably doesn‚Äôt look a lot like the marquee you had in mind, but now‚Äôs the fun part and where we bring it all together‚Ä¶ CSS time.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Through a very simple CSS transform animation you can create the effect of the content moving from one side to the other.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

As promised at the beginning, I was going to add a few bonus customisations that will make this section even better!

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

In the code above you learnt how to make the marquee move right to left, but you might need to move the opposite way, to do this it‚Äôs as easy as changing the-100%value to100%, you should then see that it has switched directions.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

The speed can also easily be changed by just simply updating the animation time from the default4sto whatever you need.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

If you want to give your section more space vertically then change thepadding-blockvalue, and if you want to give each item in the marquee more space so the gap between them is bigger you can also change thepadding-inlinevalue.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Another really cool customisation that I‚Äôve been asked a few times for by clients is the ability for it to stop when the customer hovers above the section, this is actually really easy too and can be achieved in just a couple lines of code.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

This marquee section does not only just work for text either, I recently built this section below for a client who needed to show off all their magazine cover designs and the same exact effect worked really nicely with images

## One app I like

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I‚Äôve used[Data Export IO](https://apps.shopify.com/data-export?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-26-css-marquees)quite a few times now for different clients and have been able to save them a lot of time and money.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Whilst the app‚Äôs main use is for generating reports, which I can imagine is really useful, I‚Äôve actually found it to be amazing at automatically generating order spreadsheets that can be sent by businesses to their suppliers/manufacturers.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Previously, one client I worked with was paying staff to manually copy and paste order information into a specific format that a supplier needed so they could then ship out the order, this was taking them quite a few hours each day and they were struggling to keep up with demand.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I was able to create a new spreadsheet that used conditions and filters to get the data in the specific format that was needed. The app also has a feature where it can automatically email a pdf at a set time. I set this up to email the supplier twice a day with all the order data so that it no longer required any manual work. The client was only ever able to get this done once a day so this also meant that orders could be processed a lot quicker and allow customers to get them sooner.

## One learning as a freelancer

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Before working within the e-commerce and Shopify space, I worked as a developer on other software development projects and even did my masters degree in Computer Science. The people interacting with the software we built were always called ‚Äòusers‚Äô.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

When I made that transition to just working in the e-commerce space, I had to shift my mindset from calling them users and begin referring to them as customers. This was part of training my thought process to realise that nearly every decision I make as a developer in e-commerce can have big effects on metrics like conversions and revenue.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Sometimes it‚Äôs easy to forget the effect we can have on businesses and a lot of the time clients won‚Äôt understand the decisions we make in the code, so it‚Äôs really up to us to ensure that we are writing clean code and producing accessible, SEO friendly front-end work.

## What I've been thinking about

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

In both my agency work and in freelancing, a common message I receive from clients goes along the lines of ‚Äòwe are having this problem‚Ä¶Can you install this app for us‚Ä¶‚Äô

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Clients often come from a non-technical background and are usually looking for the quickest, and cheapest solution to fix their issue. This definitely isn‚Äôt wrong, the Shopify App Store is full of so many amazing apps that are critical in most businesses and can quickly allow you to roll out new features. However, as I work on more and more projects, I am seeing so many opportunities for developers to build custom solutions - I would like to propose a new way of thinking, and it‚Äôs the idea of thinking in terms of Sections and Blocks.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

With the rollout of ‚ÄòSections Everywhere‚Äô, Sections have become an integral part of every Shopify store‚Äôs customization and allow you to reuse ‚Äòmodules of content‚Äô across the whole website, this is a concept most merchants are aware of and usually have a decent understanding of how they can use them to update their store.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I‚Äôve worked on planning out features for some of the biggest brands on the Shopify platform and in doing so, I‚Äôve learned to take the idea and break it down into its most simplistic form. This usually starts with just seeing if the new feature needs to be added to an already existing area on the site through a snippet or block, or does it actually need to be its own standalone section. If it‚Äôs the latter, it‚Äôs usually going to have more settings and require some more planning.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

From this point, I‚Äôd then make the decision on whether we need to use blocks or not. Blocks are very helpful when there are many pieces of different information that we need to store and utilize within a section, for example, if we just need to have a heading and paragraph of text, these would be perfect as section settings, especially because we know exactly how many pieces of information we need to store. However, if we wanted to store many images for a carousel but we‚Äôre not sure how many and the client also wants to add different links and headings, blocks quickly become a much better solution.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

You‚Äôre probably thinking ‚ÄòWe know this already‚Äô and ‚ÄòHow is this thinking going to change the way I build projects‚Äô, so I want to go through so more advanced examples I‚Äôve come across in the past and show how these brands may have actually built the feature, these are also often the ones that clients end up using apps for.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Mega Navs

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Mega navs are something I work on a lot for clients and from speaking with other developers, I know that we all run into the same problems when working with Shopify‚Äôs very basic navigation setup, it definitely requires some creative thinking to be able to add all the custom features clients ask for.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

You can see that Gymshark has featured content spots under each main category within the navigation, you might be thinking ‚ÄòHow have they managed to add the images, text, link, and new tag all within the navigation setup‚Äô. There definitely are ways you could do this within the navigation setup, for example having the link title field contain the image URL, text, and new tag, e.g. [image_url_here]New Releases[badge_new] and then using Liquid to grab all this information and format it in the correct way, however, that‚Äôs quite messy and I can guarantee the client will forget how this works after a while.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Another approach that I‚Äôve actually recently used on a big project was to have blocks set up under the header section that has a Parent Link Title to allow you to link the featured content within the block to the actual link in the navigation. This is a much more intuitive approach for the client and allows you to create as many block settings as you need for all the additional customizations, as well as provide detailed labels for each setting.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Bundle Builders

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I recently worked on a bundle builder that was very similar to the one on Represent Clothing‚Äôs site. We originally explored different apps that were available, not only did a lot of them not have the specific features we needed but they also lacked the styling customization that would be needed to make it fit in with the rest of the site - This is a huge problem because as you work with brands who care a lot more about their brand aesthetic, you need to ensure that every piece of work you do matches their brand guidelines - So we actually began exploring how we could build it from scratch, implement all the features that were required and have a completely custom design that was very unique compared to their competitors.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

We created a new section that had blocks for each stage of the builder, these acted as the categories and each block would have a set amount of product settings so that the client can choose which products are displayed under that specific collection.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Product Quizzes

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

When you have a selection of products and customers choose them based on subjective opinions, it can often be quite difficult to ensure that they are shown the right product - Product quizzes are a great way to find out information about your customer and provide them a tailored experience to suggest a product that meets their needs. From a first look you might think that it would be very difficult to build one using only Liquid and Javascript, however, I actually just finished working on one and was really happy with the solution we went with.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

We were able to use blocks for each stage of the quiz, so each one would have a setting for the question text and then a set number of answers. The answers would have a setting for the text that is displayed and the value that we would use in the code.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

So as the customer is choosing an answer to each question, you can just update the front end to display the content from the next block. You‚Äôll still need some kind of logic in the code to ensure that the right products are recommended, we chose to go with a point system where each answer value has a value attached to it, and through a config table, we could match products to the specific amount of points.

There are many more examples I‚Äôve run into in the past but these are 3 quite common ones I notice regularly. You may have read through all of this article and still think that you need an app for your specific use case, and that‚Äôs totally fine! But this is definitely something to keep in mind for when you‚Äôre working with an app that just isn‚Äôt meeting all your needs, it‚Äôs worth breaking down the problem and exploring ways you can build a solution. Even if clients have restricted budgets, they‚Äôre often very open to paying the one-off development cost instead of the monthly payments for an app when you break how much it will actually cost long term.

## 3 links you can't miss

- Shopify Examples- This is an amazing resource that curates some of the best Shopify stores and lets you filter by very common features. I‚Äôve used it many times when I‚Äôm not working with a designer to help guide me in the right direction. Plus it‚Äôs also great to see some sites you‚Äôve worked on be featured as well.
- Balance- If you‚Äôre anything like me, you‚Äôve gone through many different methods of tracking time. Balance is definitely one to look into.
- Bento Link in Bio- Despite being developers, we‚Äôve definitely all gone through times where we try to build our personal sites and then end up getting side-tracked. If you‚Äôre currently going through this, here‚Äôs a really nice link in bio service that you can use in the meantime and it uses the popular Bento Grid style design

## One app I like

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I‚Äôve worked with quite a few different product option apps and I really enjoy working with[Mageworx‚Äôs Advanced Product Options](https://apps.shopify.com/advanced-product-options?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-25-thinking-in-terms-of-sections-and-blocks). I‚Äôve recommended it to quite a few different clients after they found huge bugs with other similar apps and the number of 5-star reviews speak for itself.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

You can very quickly get it set up on stores and begin adding additional options to allow merchants to provide custom products to their customers.

## One learning as a freelancer

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

When you‚Äôre early into your career, it‚Äôs definitely a good idea to explore many different opportunities and learn as much as possible. But once you start getting more advanced, I‚Äôve found that it‚Äôs actually really good to narrow down the type of projects you work on. This will allow you to become a specialist in that specific area and provide better work for your clients. There have also been many times I‚Äôve worked on projects that I‚Äôm definitely capable of completing but they end up taking a lot more time than expected because they aren‚Äôt my forte, whereas I could have stuck to when I enjoy most and made more in the time it took me.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

You might also be familiar with the quote ‚ÄòRiches are in the niches', this is definitely something I‚Äôve found to be true and you‚Äôll often have a lot more clients reaching out if you specialize in a specific area.

## Is hourly billing dead?

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

The hourly billing model has a bad rap. For many reasons, some good, and some bad, a lot of people are trying to distance themselves from it as much as possible. Having experimented with many billing models, I actually came back to hourly for most of my projects. Keep reading to understand why.

## Where did hourly billing come from anyway?

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

This type of billing was used [for the first time by Reginald Heber Smith](https://www.lolg.ca/docs/default-source/default-document-library/the-billable-hour-is-dead-long-live-the-billable-hour.pdf?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-24-is-hourly-billing-dead), a lawyer that incorporated the concepts of Taylorism (the scientific measurement of work) to the law profession. You can thank (or hate) him for the 6 minute increment billing. The idea was to increase efficiency and transparency in a way that would make law more accessible to people of modest means. Before that, lawyers billed for ""services rendered"". Basically, it was any (generally astronomical) number the lawyer picked out of a hat, based on their gut feeling about the work required.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Hourly billing was invented to decrease costs, and increase transparency and efficiency. Not something people would credit it for, 100 years later. Where did it go wrong?

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

It went wrong when law firms figured the best way to increase the bottom line was to put insane billing hours targets on all their lawyers, of up to 2,000 hours per year. This means 40 billable hours every week, for 50 weeks of every year, which is insanity. Healthy numbers for billable vs admin hours are somewhere from 60-40 to 70-30, which gives around 5-6 billable hours for 2-3 admin hours.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

For those lawyers with a target of 2,000 billable hours, that would mean spending anywhere from 2,800 to 3,300 office hours per year, which translates to 56-66 hours per week at the office, or 11-13h per day, 5 days a week, 50 weeks a year. No wonder hourly billing gets artificially inflated in those conditions. There's no way you can be 100% productive and deliver high quality work when squeezed hard like that.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I truly believe hourly can work if you don't have the pressure of billing a crazy amount of hours per year. I've been averaging from 900-1,600 office hours in the last few years, with about 80% being ""billable"", for an average of 18-32h / week. With that flexibility, I can afford to be honest and transparent to my clients, and offer a high level of service by not being overworked.

### Alternative billing methods I tried

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

When I started freelancing, I followed the advice of many business gurus, and created a productized service. It was totally unlinked from the amount of hours worked, and focused on specific tasks to accomplish.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

The package was a fixed monthly cost, in addition to a percentage of increased profit, for unlimited consulting and dev work. Basically, I would do anything that wasn't part of ""day-to-day"" operations. It was all very well-defined in a nice contract, to set expectations correctly.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Despite my good intentions, I had multiple problems with this approach, and they were all related to said expectations. What I thought would happen, and what actually happened, was totally different.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

The expectation was that the flat fee would incentivize the client to use the services: use it or lose it. The percentage on extra profit would incentivize the supplier (me) to provide quality advice and work that actually moves the needle in the right direction.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

The problem was, I didn't have all the levers to move the needle.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I didn't control media budgets. I didn't control product selection and pricing. I didn't control day-to-day branding and messaging. And I certainly didn't control the actual business decisions going on with clients.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Another problem was that some clients asked for the output of a full-service agency with tens of people on their account, while it was expected from the start the output would be from a single person. Again, expectations didn't meet reality.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Despite offering quality work and advice, I realized my work and advice wasn't the main variable in a successful business. I'm just one of many levers the business owner has access to, which ultimately holds the ultimate responsibility in steering the ship the right way.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

These experiences made me think: the only thing I have complete control on is the amount of time and effort I put in for a client. The closest proxy for this is time. This is why I decided to go back to transparent and honest hourly billing.

I've had to set-up tracking for a client in Europe last week, and found [Pandectes GDPR Compliance](https://apps.shopify.com/gdpr-cookie-consent?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-24-is-hourly-billing-dead). While they have a free plan that gives you a privacy banner that actually works with the Shopify Privacy API (while Shopify's own privacy app doesn't), they also offer auto-tracking blocking for non-devs, on paid plans. It's one of the nicest UIs I've seen for these types of apps so far. Clean, powerful and well organized. It's now my go-to privacy app!

## One learning as a freelancer

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

How you set up your hourly packages is important in terms of perceived value. I have a few different ways of selling my time, but they all share one thing: the more hours that are booked, and the more committed the client is to my services, the cheaper it gets per hour. This lets me keep admin hours low, since having a lot of small clients brings a lot of overhead in terms of non-billable time. These are the options I offer:

- One-time 1h meeting: highest per hour fee, since it has the most admin overhead. I've saved clients tens of thousands of dollars on some of these calls, so even though the dollar amount per hour is fairly high, the value generated is huge.
- Prepaid time bank: I offer only two options, for twenty and forty hours, prepaid and non-refundable. These are about 15% cheaper, and 25% cheaper, than my 1h meeting fee.
- Monthly retainer: My retainers are structured as an ""up to x hours per month"" package, and are also prepaid. I offer ""up to 10h"" and up to 20h"" retainers, with a 25% discount and a 30% discount, respectively. These clients are limited (I take up to 60h/month in retainers) and get the highest level of service, as the time is 100% reserved for them. The advantage for the client is that I'll always be available for them for last-minute requests, and the advantage for me is a steady revenue stream. Win-win!

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I also do some project based billing, when something is very predictable, or the client insists on a flat rate, but I always cap them to a certain amount of hours, to avoid scope creep and unpredictable events.

## What I've been thinking about

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I'm just out of a crazy crunch , where I had two very customized landing pages to build in tight time frames. The pages were both using totally different styles than the main store. No problemo, I thought, it's not my first (or my last!) crunch, and I can juggle them and get everything out on time with minimal suffering. One thing I didn't account for, is they were both on very old legacy themes (one was on Debut 1.1!), with a ton of customizations from various devs over time. Needless to say, it was a complete mess, and it made me work a lot more evenings than I expected! Nevertheless, working on those got me thinking a lot about how to avoid those issues in my future builds. Mainly, I've been thinking about modularity, upgrade paths, merchant implication, and ease of future dev work, depending on different starting points. I see three broad categories that would cover most bases:

- Starting from scratch
- Starting from a Minimalist theme, such asDawn
- Starting from a Premium Theme, such asFlex

### Starting from scratch

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I think this is a bad starting point in 99% of cases. There are three main issues:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

1) You'll be rebuilding a wheel that has already been built a million times. You don't need to write the cart form from nothing, when it's basically always built the same way. You don't need to redo collection pagination, when it's already a solved problem. And you definitely don't need to rebuild a schema for an image + text section yet again. Who loves building schemas, anyway?

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

2) However awesome you are, the tradeoff between quality, cost, and time to delivery will be a bad one. For a full-featured site, it will either cost an obscene amount of money, take a zillion years, or corners will be cut. There's simply no way a ""blank-slate"" start will give the same quality as a commercial theme with thousands, if not tens of thousands man-hours sunk into it.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

3) Maintainability. There won't be any upgrade paths, because, well, there won't be any upgrades unless the client asks you. The web being always evolving, it might be good for the dev's wallet, but it won't be good for the clients' sanity.

### Starting from a Minimalist Theme

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

A Minimalist, HTML/CSS first, JS second theme is the best starting point for sites that want to strike the right balance between ease of custom development, and ease of use for the merchant. Devs can implement the brand guidelines using section and theme schemas as soft guardrails, and allow the merchant to recreate what he requires within the theme customizer with just enough control to avoid visual spaghetti.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Using a theme like Dawn, upgrade paths are easy if the customizations on top of the theme are built smartly. I like to keep edits to existing CSS files such asbase.cssto a minimum, and duplicate sections that are close to my needs by adding scoped CSS declarations within the duplicated section using the#shopify-section-selector. This way, my CSS only applies to my custom section, and I can upgrade my theme with very little fuss whenever a new feature or bug fix is pushed, since the original theme sections are untouched. Performance would be sliiiightly better if the CSS was all in the same file, but I prefer to keep things modular for easy maintainability.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I love how easy Dawn is to work with. Every section has its own .css and .js file, and the minimal JS is easy to understand and tweak if needed. It's the best of both worlds - you can do custom spec sections with minimal complexity, on top of a full feature set where you don't need to reinvent the wheel. If I have to dev anything, Dawn is my #1 choice!

### Starting from a Premium Theme

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Premium themes like Flex are great for merchants that want to avoid dev work. They're easy to use, well documented, have great support, and are surprisingly flexible. I mean, if you look at [Fresh](https://demos.outofthesandbox.com/?theme=Flex&style=Fresh&utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-23-mission-new-build), [Glow](https://demos.outofthesandbox.com/?theme=Flex&style=Glow&utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-23-mission-new-build)or [Techno](https://demos.outofthesandbox.com/?theme=Flex&style=Techno&utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-23-mission-new-build), you could easily believe they're three totally different themes. But they're all built on Flex, within the Customizer, with no dev work at all.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

For merchants with limited technological expertise, wanting to do their own build, resorting to a developer only for slight tweaks outside what the theme can offer, it's a fine starting point. Upgrades will also be easy as long as there are few customizations to the code, using the respective theme developer's upgrade paths.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Where premium themes are weaker is when you need to open the hood to go deeper than the presentation layer. For example, in the past, I had to modify how Flex adds products to the cart to include a minimum quantity and a pack size feature. Flex manages add-to-carts in JS. It has two main JS files totaling over 3000 lines of code, and 25 JS modules having 100-2000 lines each. While the JS is cleanly written with helpful names and comments, it's still a major undertaking to modify such a code base for a custom use case. It took much longer than if I had to do it within a less JS heavy theme. And however well you do the job, upgrades to the latest theme versions will be more complex, since it's more difficult to stay modular with edits.

## One app I like

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

[Bundle Builder](https://apps.shopify.com/bundlebuilder?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-23-mission-new-build) - One thing I wouldn't touch inside a theme would be managing complex bundle logic. I had a client that had functionality like this built in jQuery on his theme, using customizer fields to manage products included in bundles. It was an unmaintainable monster that had cost over $20,000 (before I came in!), and it was broken half the time. We integrated this app, reduced code complexity, and increased merchant independence.

## One learning as a freelancer

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

When discussing or planning a project, take the time to understand the client needs. The real ones. Help him put his needs into words by asking the right questions. Then, using your experience through multiple clients, and the clients' knowledge of his business and industry as a guide, weigh the pros and cons together. Lastly, put the client needs above yours to make the best decision, and then commit to it no matter what.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

For example, even though my work is easier when a build is on Dawn, I don't hesitate to recommend a premium theme, if I think it will fit the needs of the client better.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

That's it for this issue! I hope it will give you food for thought on your next build.

Finally! I thought. No more DOM scraping and finicky template hacks that need to be tweaked for every theme. I‚Äôll be able to create one script to rule them all, I thought.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Eagerly, I went on the Customer Events page, set-up a GTM script on the ‚Äúall_events‚Äù event just to test things out, plugged everything in excitedly and‚Ä¶ nothing. Nothing was firing at all. I was pretty bummed, so I dived in the docs a bit further. Ah, I discovered, those cool events are [sandboxed](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/promoting-marketing/pixels/overview?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-22-jailbreaking-customer-events#pixels-sandbox-environment). No luck on getting an easy win there.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Not one to quit, I went deep in the rabbit hole, and tried a million ways to get those sweet sweet events out of their cage, each more hacky than the next. Then I stumbled on the holy grail: [postMessage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-22-jailbreaking-customer-events). It‚Äôs built specifically for communicating data between windows, sandboxed iframes being one of those use cases.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

While this method is not officially supported by Shopify, it uses a well documented function, so it should be fairly safe to use.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Add this to theme.liquid and checkout additional scripts:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

And create a custom pixel with this:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

What's going to happen with this is that the complete event data for every customer event will be sent over as a JSON string, which will trigger a dataLayer.push event on the main window, that you can use however you'd like. You'll be able to set-up custom out of the customer event names, parse the data coming from customer events, etc.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

This is the basic code that you should tweak for your needs. For example, you might need to structure the data according to GA4 schema. In that case, you could structure it within the Customer Events code block, to send a clean JSON object to catch on the main window. Or you could keep the ""raw"" object coming from Customer Events, and organize it on the main Window using GTM. It's your choice!

## One learning as a freelancer

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Gaining the trust of your clients is your #1 job. Even if you're a fantastic developer, a genius marketer, or the most creative designer, you'll never succeed without trust.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

In my experience, a less obvious way to gain trust comes from being 100% honest about what you're thinking, and not being afraid to say things that might not be what the client wants to hear. The client pays for your advice and experience, so keeping something for yourself fearing it might hurt the client is doing him a disservice.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Obviously, there's a way and a time to tell things earnestly. It needs to be told in a constructive and non-judgmental way, and you also need to listen to the clients' response intently. Your opinion might change when you hear about the context. There might be a piece of information you were missing!

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Apart from sharing your honest opinion in an open and constructive way, the obvious way to gain trust is to be reliable. Don't drop balls. Set expectations clearly. Communicate setbacks. Do what's best for the client.

### Who is this Quebecois / French-Canadian guy?

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Here's the story of how I fell into freelancing:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I started working in digital communications in 2011. 5 years later, I went back to University for a Master's in Marketing. After graduating, I worked in-house for small businesses as the ""go-to marketing and technical guy"". That's where I realized I really liked dev work, feeling it was the most ""tangible"" part of my work.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

In 2019, I had my first child (now at two!), lost my job (that sucked), and built a SaaS business from scratch (still alive, on the backburner). Let's say it was en eventful year! But since that time, I'm proud to say I'm boss free, and intend to keep it that way. There's something exhilarating about being freelance full time, that I might talk about in a future issue.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Now, by a mix of luck and hard work, I have (mostly) fun, challenging and rewarding work from a roster of local and international clients, and losing my job seems like the best thing that could've happened to me!

### Staying organized: The biggest challenge of the solo freelancer

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I'm not a naturally organized person. It's simply not something I like, or have an affinity for. Over the years, I developed strategies, found tricks, and set-up tools to compensate for this. 2 books helped me set up the groundwork for this:

- Getting Things Done - The Art of Stress-Free Productivity by David Allen
- Deep Work - Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World by Cal Newport

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I adapted these books for how my brain works and made these rules:

- The Under 10 Minutes Rule: If a task takes less than 10 minutes, do it right away.
- The TMS/Calendar Rule: If a task or meeting is not in my Task Management System (TMS) or calendar, it doesn't exist
- The 30 Minutes Rule: Work at least 30 minutes on a task before switching to anything else
- The Tracking Rule:Time everything

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

These four rules have had profound effects on my productivity and stress levels!

## 1. The Under 10 Minutes Rule

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

If a task takes less than 10 minutes, do it right away.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Basically, it takes more time and energy to note a short task to do later, than to do it right away. But you can't use it to ""break out"" of a 30 minute focused work session!

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

For example, while reading emails, I complete small tasks and respond accordingly. During meetings or phone calls, I use an inexpensive notepad to jot down highly condensed notes. Afterward, I either complete small tasks immediately or file them This rule, coupled with the TMS/Calendar rule (below), simplifies decision-making as you get hammered with new tasks over your day.

## 2. The Under 10 Minutes Rule

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

If a task or meeting is not in my Task Management System (TMS) or calendar, it doesn't exist

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Simply trusting your brain to remember something at a later time is both error-prone and stressful. Trying to remember all your tasks (personal or professional) is quite simply bonkers.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

There's a million TMS's out there. I really like[](https://clickup.com/?fp_ref=jean-philippe38&utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-21-productivity-hacks)[Clickup](https://clickup.com/?fp_ref=jean-philippe38&utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-21-productivity-hacks), which is the only one that ""sticked"" with me, but you can use whichever one you like. The two important things you need are:

- A reminder mechanism: a way for your TMS to remind you of something on a specific day
- A status mechanism: a way to tag a task according to how it's progressing.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

For the reminder mechanism, I use due dates. For statuses, I have a simple progression: Inbox ‚ûù To Do ‚ûù In Progress OR Waiting/Delegated ‚ûù Complete OR No Longer Needed

## 3. The 30 Minute Rule

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Work at least 30 minutes on a task before switching to anything else

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

You'll find a million variations of this rule all over the Internet, the most famous one being the Pomodoro Technique. Pomodoro is the Italian word for tomato, and refers to tomato-shaped kitchen timers. Legend says early pomodorists would set a 25-minute timer, be 100% focused for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break, then start over again.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

While I think it's a great way to start gaining focus in work, I personally don't like this approach, as it forces an interruption when you might have gotten into a state of flow. I prefer to minimize interruptions by silencing all notifications, flipping my phone upside down, and closing down all non-necessary tabs.

## 4. The Tracking Rule

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Time everything

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

The first time I had to track my time, at my first agency job, I despised it. It didn't help that we used a horrendous time entry system that crashed half the time, but that's another story.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I started tracking my time again when I started working on my graduate thesis, using[](https://toggl.com/track/?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-21-productivity-hacks)[Toggl](https://toggl.com/track/?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-21-productivity-hacks). I was curious to know just how much time a huge project like a grad thesis took. Soon after, I realized something: I wasmuch more focused. Tracking myself doing a specific thing, I felt like I was ""cheating"" if I did anything else. It seems silly, but it worked!

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Since then, I've tracked every (working) hour of every day, whether I need to for billing purposes, or not. I've found it reduces task switching and increases self-accountability, since I want to keep that timer running, and want to see in my weekly report if I‚Äôve been slacking off. And it's also just easier to bill clients, as I can give them a detailed breakdown of time spent on tasks.

## My personal next steps

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I don't have ""the method to rule them all"". But hopefully, you might benefit from seeing how I work.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Hope this gave a few ideas on how to improve your productivity, and decrease your stress!

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

On my end, my next steps in terms of organization are to get a good Knowledge Management System in place. I started dabbling with[](https://obsidian.md/?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-21-productivity-hacks)[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-21-productivity-hacks)and the[](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-21-productivity-hacks)[Zettelkasten Method](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-21-productivity-hacks), but I'm far from having made it a habit yet. Maybe I need to put that in my TMS?

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Up to this point I have written three newsletters about web development that have mentioned very little code. I thought I might change that for this week.

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

As a Shopify developer you regularly find yourself working on pre-existing themes that are either pre-bought or custom made, often with Javascript that has been compiled before deployment. This can make it hard to understand or customize safely.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

In recent times I‚Äôve become increasingly interested in componentizing my Shopify work. For example, so that a custom section I add to a theme is not reliant on anything outside of itself.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

This could, of course, be achieved using Section assets, but when using Javascript in particular this can be risky as you can inadvertently apply some code that could interfere with functions used elsewhere in the theme causing bugs and potential headaches once deployed.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I was recently introduced to Alpine.js which is ‚Äúa rugged, minimal tool for composing behavior directly in your markup. Think of it like jQuery for the modern web. Plop in a script tag and get going.‚Äù Now on first seeing this I balked slightly, I‚Äôve spent the last 5 years of my career in a wholehearted commitment to working with vanilla JS as much as possible and of removing jQuery from my toolkit so to consider using something compared to it was troubling to say the least.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

However, it is lightweight, easy to use and best of all when using it, the code you add applies only to that component and items referenced by it and nothing else. As a result you can interact with an existing theme with as little intrusion as possible. Simply addx-datato the containing element of your component and go from there.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

To give you an idea of how Alpine can be used I‚Äôve put together a very simple demo which sees a free product applied to a form once a certain quantity has been added to the shopping cart. Find where to view this demo in the link section below.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

This incorporates an incredibly handy and sparsely documented feature of Shopify.. Adding the below code to a product form, with the variant id set as an actual id from the inventory of the store you are working on, will see it added to the cart alongside the product you are purchasing when you submit the form.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

This opens up a simple, no-app solution to options such as adding free gifts, promo products or even product bundles to an order. Thanks to [Rob Dukarski](https://www.storetasker.com/experts/rob-dukarski?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-20-the-one-with-actual-code-in-it), a fellow Storetasker, who mentioned this on the Experts Slack channel.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I myself used it recently to add a complimentary tote bag to an order when a certain product was purchased. In this instance the corresponding product uses a custom product metafield so that you can select a ‚ÄòFree Gift‚Äô product to link to the main product. Then in the product template if that metafield is set, the variant.id of the free gift is automatically added to the hidden input field.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

There are a multitude of ways in which this simple feature can be used to make custom solutions for your clients requirements and Alpine.js gives you an array of options that can be streamlined into your working process quickly and easily.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

As I‚Äôve started to incorporate Alpine into my work I found that one of its greatest strengths is when, say, building a custom section for a theme you can simply copy and paste that section to a different theme and it will work as expected, opening up the opportunity to create yourself a component library that you can use across all of your future Shopify work.

## 3 links you can‚Äôt miss:

- Alpine.js / Free Gift input Demo-A demo that I‚Äôve put together to illustrate a simple way to use the features mentioned above. Be aware this is not intended as a plug and play example, more as a basic, rough introduction to some basic Alpine features. Read the comments in the source code for details.
- Stortasker Rob Dukarski- I mentioned Rob earlier; follow him on his LinkedIn account or you will regularly see him on the Storetasker Experts Slack channel. His advice and insight has been of great help in recent times. Thanks Rob!
- The Baymard Institute- Ever wondered if the way your site is designed is helping with conversion rates, or looking for ways to improve your layout using rigorously tested best in class functionality examples to compare it to? Then, this is a good place to visit.

## One app I like:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

App Required?/App Audit:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

As this is my last edition of the newsletter I promised myself that I would make my final app recommendation more a suggestion than a direct recommendation. That being; can the task be done without an app. On a recent app audit for a client we discovered they had installed apps over the years that were either not required or sometimes not even implemented, but yet the injected code from those apps was still being called on every visit to that site to the detriment of the user experience.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Improvements in the Shopify API and the addition of metafields/metaobjects content means that there is so much more that Shopify can offer without the use of third party apps. Question whether an app is required and remove those that aren‚Äôt, you will save your client money and increase their site speed with comparative ease.

## One learning as a freelancer:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

This last month I was lucky enough to work on the relaunch of the [PerfectTed](https://www.perfectted.com/?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-20-the-one-with-actual-code-in-it) website, they make Matcha based energy drinks and wanted to rebuild their website in time for their appearance on [Dragons‚Äô Den](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m001jnkg/dragons-den-series-20-episode-9?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-20-the-one-with-actual-code-in-it) (the UK version of ‚ÄòShark Tank‚Äô) which was broadcast 2 weeks ago.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I was introduced to them via Storetasker and it‚Äôs been a privilege to work with a company as their public profile has been given a sudden and significant increase. Watching the Live View of their store admin as the show was broadcast was extraordinary as traffic and, most importantly sales, started to flood in. In amongst this deluge of visitors and interaction it was noticeable that Shopify didn‚Äôt even blink; at no point did their servers struggle with the visitor spike.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Asides from the reminder that appearing on television is still a massive promotional boost (the week after their appearance the company had a 42,000% sales increase), the whole experience was a perfect summation of one of the truisms I‚Äôve encountered as a freelancer; that the best jobs you will work on come from a mixture of your expertise, the quality of the relationship with your client and sheer luck and happenstance.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Sometimes an opportunity will present itself to you unexpectedly and if I can make any recommendation to fellow developers it is to trust your instincts when they arise and if the opportunity feels right to commit to it fully.

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

As a developer you will often find yourself being asked to add elements to a client‚Äôs site or to be more specific, adding elements to existing Shopify stores and themes.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

These will sometimes be elements that a client has coveted on other sites or that they have seen their competitors use and want to incorporate themselves. Trends can be seductive to a client and easy go-tos for us as developers.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

But what happens when you take that request, have a look at the client's website and realize that what they are requesting will bring them little to no benefit and comes purely from a position of wanting to keep up with the Joneses?

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

To illustrate what I mean here I‚Äôm going to focus on one aspect of UI design, the ubiquitous hero image/content carousel. We‚Äôve all seen them, we‚Äôve all built them and none of us have ever interacted with or normally ever seen anything beyond the 4th slide in that carousel.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

In talks about a site build with a client recently I was asked to add a carousel to their home page as they felt it was a great way to get multiple messages across to their customers, a noble cause if ever there was one.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

But I pushed back and asked, ‚ÄòHow many times have you ever really sat and looked through all of the content in an accordion?‚Äô.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

They paused for a moment, ‚ÄòBut everyone else uses them so they must work right?‚Äô

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

A reasonable assumption, but is it a correct one? I‚Äôve always had my suspicions about their effectiveness, so I went looking for an answer and lo and behold it would appear that they absolutely do not work.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I came across a fascinating article by UX professional Robert Mohns. In this he outlines the significant dropoff that occurs on a carousel after the 1st slide and the research that proves it.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

To quote from the article:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

The clearest numbers yet were provided by Erik Runyon of Notre Dame University:

- 3.7 million visitors
- 1.07% clicked the carousel
- 89.1% of those clicked the first slide
- Positions 2‚Äì5 received 3.1% to 2.4% of clicks

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

That‚Äôs a minority of your users that interact with the carousel, with a drop-off rate of those who continue to interact after the first slide that is genuinely astonishing.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

For most websites the addition of a content carousel will in reality provide the following to your client; A media heavy component that will significantly increase the load time of their website with the content contained within the carousel never to be seen by the vast majority of site visitors. Or put simply, something that brings no real benefits to your client.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

As Mohns succinctly states:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

‚ÄúThe data says static, unmoving feature with simple, concise copy and a clear call to action will out-perform a carousel every time.‚Äù

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I‚Äôve picked Hero carousels as an example here but as developers it is our responsibility to listen to what a client requests, research the outcome of that addition, consider the benefits it will bring them and then advise them accordingly.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Sometimes that advice will be contrary to the client‚Äôs request but this honesty will create trust between you and the client and maintain your integrity as a developer.

## 3 links you can‚Äôt miss:

- Do Homepage Carousels work?by Robert Mohns. Take a look at the full article referenced above here. Astonishingly it was written in 2015 and yet carousels are still endemic on current websites. Are they always a bad idea? Maybe not always; product image slideshows for example - but on the whole it really does seem so.
- Taylor Page's Youtube Channel- A fellow freelance developer and Storetasker expert, Taylor has in the last few months started dipping his toes into Shopify video tutorials and I thoroughly recommend taking a look and subscribing to his channel for helpful nuggets of Shopify knowledge.
- Rich Page CRO teardowns- I have recently started following CRO experts on LinkedIn to get their perspective on the current state of UI/UX design and development. I follow Rich Page and he occasionally posts a CRO teardown of a popular website - I find it incredibly interesting to watch someone pick apart the reasons a page may or may not be working.

## One app I like:

- Colorsnapper- It‚Äôs Mac only, it‚Äôs nothing to do with Shopify - but this simple app contains a shortcut which sees a magnifying glass appear on your screen and using it you can click a color on screen and it records that color in almost every conceivable value. I use this app more times in a day than I can say.

## One learning as a freelancer:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Sometimes pushing back on a client‚Äôs requests could be seen as having a negative impact on your working relationships and income.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

But I have found the opposite of this more often than not. If a client requests something that you know, and can prove, will not bring them the results that they are looking for then it is your responsibility to let them know.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Saying ‚ÄòNo‚Äô is not always a negative response, look around at the client‚Äôs site and look for updates or additions that will bring tangible results. Use it as an opportunity to find other avenues of growth for them. Your honesty and expertise could take that ‚Äòno‚Äô and change it into a working relationship based on trust and transparency.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

As always I appreciate your time in reading this. Have a great rest of week.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Hey all üëã!

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Welcome to ['i_only_speak_liquid' by Storetasker](https://ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com/?_gl=1*337bqj*_ga*MzQ4OTUyMDQ2LjE2NTM0NzIzOTc.*_ga_E6Y4WLQ2EC*MTY2MTE2MTMxMy42NS4xLjE2NjExNjM0NTUuNjAuMC4w), where active Shopify developers like me [(Mark)](https://www.storetasker.com/experts/mark-wilson?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-18-soft-skills) share learnings we face daily. Hope you enjoy my notes.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

PS: I'm an expert on [Storetasker](https://www.storetasker.com/become-an-expert?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-18-soft-skills): It‚Äôs a gated network of vetted Shopify developers.

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Recently I had a meeting with a potential client and towards the end of our chat they said to me, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so nice to have a call with a developer I can actually talk to normally, so many I‚Äôve spoken to have such a minimal amount of soft skills and it‚Äôs hard work‚Ä¶‚Äù I smiled and thanked them for saying so.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Afterward I realized that I wasn‚Äôt entirely sure what soft skills actually are or meant. I appreciate that this is a statement that may surprise you, dear reader, but ‚Äòsoft skills‚Äô is a term I‚Äôd occasionally heard but never really considered. So I looked it up:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

‚ÄúSoft skills are personal attributes, such as communication and interpersonal abilities, adaptability and problem-solving, that enable individuals to effectively navigate their environment and relationships.‚Äù

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Arguably a very simplistic summary of it, but equally it‚Äôs a skill that is potentially difficult to obtain or teach people how to improve. But always one for a challenge, here are a few completely unproven soft skill tips for people who work remotely and very rarely see other people during their work day aside from video calls. Or developers as we are otherwise known.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

1. Be nice and consider your audience.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

This may seem obvious but I‚Äôve been in meetings where developers will combine a heady mix of impenetrable technical jargon with an overtly patronizing tone when explaining what said jargon means.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Most clients I‚Äôve encountered don‚Äôt want to know about the technical side of things, they just want you to solve their problem and for you to be someone they can trust to do so. Being nice helps with that. Ask them how they are, maybe have a chat about something outside of work for a few minutes if the situation seems right. Small digressions aren‚Äôt necessarily a bad thing.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

2. Be present when dealing with clients.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I‚Äôve been in a meeting where a rep from a very well known tech company presented to a group of 14 people whilst eating his lunch. I have also seen people sit through entire meetings looking at their phones.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Your clients are, on the whole, people whose entire livelihoods and ambitions depend on the project you are helping them with, they deserve your full attention and interest. Anything other than that is unacceptable really.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

3. Be relatable.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

If anyone has technical issues when I‚Äôm in a meeting or there is a lot of background noise they are apologizing for I always like to tell the story of when, during lockdown, I had to present to a board of directors whilst my daughter had a flute lesson in a nearby room. She was 8 at the time and at an early stage of her learning journey, so her playing style could be referred to as ‚Äòraw‚Äô. The sound carried far, far more than I was expecting. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever had to ride the mute button on a Zoom call with such acute dexterity before.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Using personal, relatable anecdotes like that can help create little moments of levity that put clients at ease and help build a connection between you.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Additionally, I do not recommend leading an important call during a child‚Äôs music lesson, it could be described as a foolhardy endeavor at best.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

4. Read novels.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

An unexpected tip in a newsletter for developers I‚Äôll grant you. But I‚Äôm convinced that if you read novels, especially ones about people/worlds/situations that you have no experience with, it will make you a more empathetic person and will help towards tip 1.

## 3 links you can‚Äôt miss:

- What are 'soft skills'?- If you also aren‚Äôt sure what soft skills are here is a handy explainer. If you already knew and are wondering how I managed to get this far into working life without an understanding of the phrase; well, that makes two of us.
- The New Gurus- Whilst writing this I realized that I was yet another voice on the internet giving you tips on how to better yourself. That reminded me of this fantastic podcast series by Helen Lewis where she looks into the recent trend that sees us looking for guidance in people who might not necessarily be equipped to do so. My favorite episode is on productivity (something I‚Äôm a little susceptible to looking into) particularly the guru who despite being a master of productivity still works 50+ hours a week‚Ä¶
- Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow- by Gabrielle Zevin. I recommended reading novels and so here is a recommendation for one. A book about two childhood friends who create a hugely successful computer games company. So it‚Äôs kind of about code but more about people.

## One app I like:

- Shopify Schema Builder by Encircle Technologies- I‚Äôve been building a custom Shopify theme this month and this has been indispensable as a time saving tool. A simple, easy to use assistant. Recommended.

## One learning as a freelancer:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

It has become apparent to me that my ability to engage, converse and relate to those that I work with is arguably as vital to my career as my technical skill set, if not more.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I have clients who I have worked with for over a decade now and consider friends before work associates and I aim to stay on good terms with all those that I work with.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

But I would be remiss to say that it has always been so. Throughout my years of work I have occasionally made mistakes, I have over promised to clients and fallen foul of it and I have not given my full attention to areas of a project I should have. These genuine mistakes have been rare moments of laxity and if it happens I do all I can to either rectify or resolve the issue.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

But we are all human and I guess that soft skills are in some way an important part of recognising, dealing and incorporating these inconsistencies into our working lives and relationships.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Google‚Äôs original code of conduct started with the motto ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt be evil‚Äô (until they ominously removed it a number of years ago‚Ä¶) and if I had a code of conduct I think mine would start with ‚ÄòBe nice‚Äô. It‚Äôs as good a starting point as any.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Thanks for taking the time to read this. I can assure you that it is most appreciated.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Cheers

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I was talking to a family member over the weekend and they asked me if I‚Äôd heard of ChatGPT and it suddenly dawned on me that the concept of user instigated AI had truly reached the public consciousness.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Now before you roll your eyes and think ‚ÄúOh great, more ChatGPT‚Ä¶‚Äù, hold on. I instead wanted to note down some thoughts about what ChatGPT and AI means to me as a developer (who incidentally uses AI tools in my development everyday) and as a person.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

The reaction in general to ChatGPT seems to sway between one of unadulterated excitement and existential panic as we ask it a question and find an answer that seems better than anything we could have come up with; instant code snippets, a sonnet about bananas written in the style of Shakespeare, exam-ready college essays etc etc. The concern comes when we think that these tools will soon replace us, that we are to become obsolete.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

As a developer this feels especially pertinent, with tools like Github CoPilot eagerly finishing your code snippets faster than you can write them and ChatGPT being able to build straightforward apps simply by asking it nicely.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

But the key issue to remember is to ask and understand what these tools actually are at this time. On the whole, they are incredibly advanced auto-complete tools; they harvest information based on what we‚Äôve asked and return what is essentially a pastiche of an answer to a similar question with no understanding of what it is telling you.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

When it comes to code the answers can be astonishingly accurate, but they can also be incomplete or just plain wrong. It is up to us as developers to know what is usable and what is not and that ability comes from the simple, old-fashioned principle of knowing your craft and that takes time, discipline and hard work. A short cut is only beneficial if you know the destination.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Personally, I feel the same goes for many of the other ways that people are using these tools. If you write your blog posts with it they will seem generic because they literally will be made from other posts in that style; homogenized, the edges all sanded down. A song will probably sound ok made from AI but it will miss that je ne sais quoi that makes music soar and inspire. Even in code, using AI could be the same as haphazardly copy and pasting from Stack Overflow without understanding what the snippet does, leading to bloated, messy, unsustainable code that you yourself don‚Äôt understand.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

What am I trying to say here? I recommend investigating, understanding these tools and incorporating them into your work process. Failing to do so will see you out of step with the industry as their complexity accelerates and it's imperative you come to terms with them.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

But more importantly I feel we need to question our usage of them, ask ourselves if the response it gives us is the best one and not just blindly use it regardless. Use them as tools not solutions and have the ability to know when is the best time and situation to use what they give us. We need to be regularly learning and refreshing the fundamentals of our craft. If you can combine this knowledge and these powerful tools, our obsolescence might well be delayed a little while longer.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Outside of coding maybe we should maintain that questioning approach before we put all of our trust into these new, incredible technologies and ask ourselves; just because something can be done doesn‚Äôt always mean it should be.

## 3 links you can‚Äôt miss:

- ChatGPT: What does this mean for developers?- ThePrimeagen is a developer who works for Netflix, primarily on the backend of things but he is also very insightful, inspiring and most importantly funny. This is his take on the effect of ChatGPT on the programming world and it mirrors a lot of my feelings on it. Also check out his other videos, I can‚Äôt recommend them enough.

- A skeptical take on the AI revolution- (Apple Podcasts link, but available on all podcast channels): A recent Ezra Klein interview with Gary Marcus, an AI expert, which sees him voicing his concerns on the direction AI is taking.
- The Red Hand files- On each of these newsletters I planned to add one or two links to something unrelated to tech as often the things that influence and direct my work are non-tech related. I‚Äôve recently been reading ‚ÄòFaith, Hope and Carnage‚Äô, a conversation between the musician Nick Cave and journalist Sean O‚Äô Hagan which I thoroughly recommend and that was going to be the link today. But Cave also writes a newsletter where he answers questions from his fans. Today whilst writing this (Jan. 16th) the latest edition of it arrived in my inbox and it‚Äôs his reaction to ChatGPT, which is such a bizarre coincidence that it only seems right to link to that instead.

## One app I like:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

[Matrixify](https://matrixify.app/?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-17-my-thoughts-on-chatgpt)

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Unrelated to AI, Matrixify is a ‚ÄòShopify Data Bulk Import Export Update & Migrate‚Äô tool. If you‚Äôve ever had to export, migrate, update, sync or do anything with large amounts of data with Shopify then you need this app in your toolkit. It is indispensable.

## One learning as a freelancer:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I‚Äôve been doing this job for a long time (15+ years‚Ä¶ yeah, I know) and am entirely self-taught, I love that about our industry; that you can forge a career entirely powered by interest, passion, determination and stubbornness (it‚Äôs important that last one) and that the educational tools are available to us to do this without even having to leave our homes. But even now, so far into my career, I still wince slightly at being referred to as an ‚Äòexpert‚Äô mainly as I will always consider myself a novice, albeit one that loves to study code.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Yet, there is so much to learn and so much development happening at such an astonishing speed that it could potentially overwhelm you. You can be an expert one day, stop paying attention for a few years and suddenly you can appear lost and out of touch or you could be starting out and have no idea which mountain to climb first.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Which leads me to the biggest code-based tip I have as a freelancer, that ties into what I was talking about earlier and that is it to make sure you know and understand the fundamentals of what you are coding. When looking into Liquid code shopify.dev is there for you, if you are using Tailwind make sure you understand the principles of CSS before you do and if you are looking at using React/Vue/Svelte take a look at something like Chris Ferdinandi‚Äôs Go Make Things to understand the principles of Javascript. It is time well spent and an investment in your ongoing career that sees you able to adapt to changes in the industry with greater ease and it will see you able to use the new generation of AI tools so much more effectively.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I hope this has been in some way interesting to you and thanks for taking the time to read it.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Oftentimes, I get the request to create a Shopify app that performs a background job.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

For this, we can use an offline app. The problem is Shopify‚Äôs offline app documentation is very outdated, so; basically, there is no documentation about creating offline apps in 2023.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Here, I will show how to switch an online node.js Shopify app (default) to offline.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Step 1:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Create your Shopify node.js app using Shopify CLI in the command line.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Step 2:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Inside the app's root directory, find the .env file and fill the SHOP variable with the myshopify.com URL of the store you want to connect the app to.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Step 3:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

In the app's root directory, find the index.js file inside the server folder and open it with your favorite code editor.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Inside the index.js file, create the following endpoint

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Also, find theUSE_ONLINE_TOKENSconstant and set it tofalse.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Step 4:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

In the root directory of the app, find the Homepage.jsx file inside the src/components/ folder and add the following button and function inside the <Page> component

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Step 5:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

In the command line, serve the app using the following code:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Once the app is served, create an installation link in your partner apps dashboard, install it and open it.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Once you open the app, click the button you created in step four.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Step 6:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

In the command line where you performed the commandshopify app serve, you will see an object with the following form:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Copy that object, we are using it in the next step.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Step 7:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Above the constant USE_ONLINE_TOKENS insert the following constant

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

And voila! Every time you need to perform a background job using your Shopify app, just call the offline_session constant instead of creating a session on the fly.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I.e., fetch the first 250 products in Shopify,

Recently, I had an issue with my communication cadence with a client. That made me reflect about how important communication is as a freelancer.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Proper communication is essential for any freelancer to be successful. It is important to establish clear communication with clients to ensure that expectations are met and that projects are completed on time and to the highest quality. Good communication also helps to build trust and rapport with clients, which can lead to repeat business and referrals. Additionally, proper communication can help to avoid misunderstandings and disputes, which can be costly and time-consuming.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

If you want to improve your communication style with your client, keep in mind the following tips:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

1. Be Professional: Always maintain a professional attitude and demeanor when communicating with clients. This includes using proper grammar and spelling, being polite and courteous, and responding to messages in a timely manner.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

2. Be Clear: Make sure that your messages are clear and concise. Avoid using jargon or technical terms that the client may not understand.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

3. Be Responsive: Respond to client messages promptly and keep them updated on the progress of their project.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

4. Be Transparent: Be honest and open with clients about any issues or delays that may arise.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

5. Listen: Listen to the client‚Äôs needs and concerns and be willing to make changes or adjustments as needed.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

6. Set Expectations: Set clear expectations for the project timeline, deliverables, and payment terms.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

7. Follow Up: Follow up with clients after the project is complete to ensure that they are satisfied with the results.

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I‚Äôve been thinking a lot lately about how some merchants need a wholesale store but can‚Äôt afford Shopify plus (yet).

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

How can you achieve wholesale functionality in a non-plus Shopify store?

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

You may use an app, but sometimes that is not possible.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Another option is modifying the theme to wholesale.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I‚Äôm explaining the latter in this guide. I‚Äôm not doing a detailed guide because each theme might be different; I‚Äôm writing a high-level guide so you can do it on your own on any theme.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Step 1:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

You need to find the templates/customers/register.liquid file. Here, we are creating a form so customers can apply to be wholesale customers.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

The above code will create a ‚Äúcreate customer‚Äù form. The hidden input will assign the tag ‚Äúwholesale‚Äù to any customer registered through this form. Feel free to add more fields. You can find the fields you can add [here](https://shopify.dev/themes/customer-engagement/additional-customer-information?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-15-unlock-wholesale-without-shopify-plus).

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Step 2:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Add the tag wholesale to all the products eligible for wholesale purchase. If the store‚Äôs inventory is high, an easy way to do it is to download the products in a CSV file, add the tag in bulk to the products in the CSV, and re-upload the CSV.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Step 3:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Create an automatic discount and apply it to all the products with the tag ‚Äúwholesale‚Äù.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Step 4:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Find the liquid files that show the price in the store. Typically, it shows in two places: On the collection cards and the product page. You can find it on product-card.liquid and product-form.liquid (for legacy themes) and in product-card.liquid and in main-product.liquid (for OS 2.0 themes).

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Keep in mind that the names could be different in some themes, and even some would have more than two files showing the price.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Add the following code at the start of each file where the price shows. Replace pre_discount_wholesale with the discount your wholesales clients will have (you had set up this in step three). For example, if the discount is 10%, replace pre_discount_wholesale for 0.1

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Now, everywhere in the liquid files you detected that show the price, replace the price for the following.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Do the same for the compare at price

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Step 5:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Find the cart liquid file. Usually, cart-template.liquid (for legacy themes) or main-cart-items.liquid (for OS 2.0 themes).

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Find the for tag inside the templates, and repeat the process in step four. Also, create another variable, sum the total with the wholesale discounts on the variable, and replace it in the total and subtotal.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Voila! Now, the store has wholesale capabilities.

CBD is a huge market. If you are in the health industry, selling CDB products could significantly increase your sales.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

However, Shopify won‚Äôt accept payments for CBD products by default. Here is where the eMerchantBroker payment gateway will help you. This payment gateway will process payments for your CDB products.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

The best part? It‚Äôs a payment gateway approved by Shopify. Take a look!

There are numerous ways to acquire clients. There are plentiful opportunities, from guest blogging and personal branding to cold emailing and job boards.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Advertising and marketplaces such as Storetasker have been successful for me, but this shouldn't prevent you from exploring other strategies. Other individuals may have success with popular job sites, for example.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Rather than getting caught up in what is right or wrong, it is essential to trust the process and dive in.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Mistakes will be made, but getting started and learning along the way is vital. After all, experience is the best teacher.

A sharp brain is critical as a freelancer. People are renting your brain by the hour/project. The sharper your mind is, the more productive you are. High productivity with solid sales/marketing skills means higher income in the long term.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

The three pillars of a sharp mind are exercise, diet, and sleep. I exercise daily for at least 15 minutes, mainly doing HIIT routines and some bodyweight exercises. In addition, I stick to a keto diet with high-quality protein and sleep at least 7 hours in a comfortable and completely dark environment.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Those are the bases for 80% of your brain sharpness. For the 20% left, there are too many options out there:

- A high-quality smartwatch to keep track of your sleep, stress, etc

- Meditation is a great way to overcome stress and anxiety.

- Sunlight regulates sleep and helps with stress and anxiety.

- Foci is a productivity tool that allows monitoring of your emotions while you work and help you overcome negative emotions like stress and anxiety.

- Modafinil is a smart pill top-rated in silicon valley as a cognitive booster and fatigue mitigator.

- Some diet supplements, like beer yeast, vitamin B complex, vitamin D, etc., keep your mind in its best state.

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about: (*written by Chat GPT)

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

As business owners, we are constantly faced with choices that can impact the success of our company. It's easy to rely on gut feel when making decisions, but to ensure accuracy, it's crucial to base our choices on data. This means tracking the key metrics that are important to our business.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

For example, I identified the five most important areas for my business and began tracking them: leads, conversion rate, average project price, total time spent on a project, and repeat client percentage. This gave me a clear view of how my business was performing.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

At first, tracking these metrics may seem excessive, but in the long run, it can greatly benefit our business and becomes even more important as our team grows. By making data-driven decisions, we can increase the chances of success for our business.

- The Shopify changelogis a valuable resource for keeping up to date with the latest changes to the platform.

Mechanic is an automation tool that offers advanced capabilities beyond what is possible in Shopify Flow. Mechanic provides a large library of existing ‚Äútasks‚Äù that can be easily implemented to automate various processes in a clients store. Additionally, you can write your own custom ""tasks"" using liquid and the Shopify API, giving even more flexibility and control.

As AI tools continue to advance at a rapid pace, there is a growing concern among some developers about whether or not these tools will replace us.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Tools like GitHub Co-Pilot and Chat GPT are able to learn from large amounts of data, much more than a human developer would ever be able to use. For example, given the prompt ""write shopify liquid code that can be used to enable gift wrapping in the cart,"" Chat GPT was able to generate the following result:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

As you can see, the results of AI code generation are impressive. But should developers be worried? In my opinion, not yet. While AI platforms are advanced, they can only generate specific snippets of code. They cannot yet understand an entire system. It remains to be seen how this will change in the future.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

For now, we can use these tools to streamline our processes and become more efficient. How often do we search for the same code snippets repeatedly? With AI code generation, we no longer have to spend time on Stack Overflow looking for answers. We can just write a quick comment and have the code generated for us, greatly increasing productivity.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Of course, small tweaks will still be needed, but making these tweaks is still easier than writing the entire block of code from scratch. In this way, AI code generation can help us work more efficiently and effectively.

In the end, AI is going to continue to advance regardless of our concerns. We can either worry about the potential of being replaced, or we can work out how we can use AI to our advantage.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Personally, I'm choosing the latter and will be using these new tools to help me be more productive and deliver better results for my clients.

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about custom upsell carousels using Tailwind CSS & Shopify CLI.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

The great thing about using Tailwind CSS here that it significantly reduces the time it takes to write CSS, and it re-uses CSS classes, so you keep CSS files small (faster load times).

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I wrote out an entire piece on how to do this with all the code snippets you might need [here](https://resources.storetasker.com/blog/custom-upsells-carousel-in-product-pages-using-tailwind-css-and-shopify-cli?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-13-custom-upsells-using-tailwind-css). Hope you find it useful!

- Shopify VS Code Extension- The official Shopify VS code extension permits you to use liquid in VS code without triggering warnings or errors; also, it allows you to use the auto-complete feature for liquid, comment code blocks using the {% comment %} tag with a hotkey, perform theme checks to find errors in a theme and other perks.
- Shopify CLI- If you are not using the Shopify CLI, you are missing massive gains in productivity during your coding workflow. It‚Äôs much easier to develop a theme locally than using the web tool on the Shopify admin. Check it out!

Even though I‚Äôm not a big fan of dropshipping (returns could drive negative margins easily), I firmly believe in dropshipping for market research.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

With drop shipping, you can import products to your Shopify store without risking your inventory, find out what products bring good sales, and then you can consider sourcing inventory in your warehouse.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

A small-risk, big-rewards way to market research, and Oberlo makes it easy.

I don‚Äôt enjoy QA as a typical programmer. Quality assurance is time-consuming and hard because you need to think outside the logic you used to create your software, and it requires building testing cases.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

However, I wanted to increase my retainers this year. So, I hired a customer retention consultant who convinced me to make QA my first priority.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I usually do unit testing for my javascript, a functional test for key features, and check fonts, font sizes, margins, paddings, widths, heights, etc. I try to make everything pixel-perfect.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I also explore the functionality of a store before working with them and check the functionality is intact after I finish implementing my code.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Since I started doing a deep QA, I discovered that my repeated customers increased, my number of revisions decreased, and clients would recommend me to their colleagues, acquaintances, and friends more.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

So, take QA very seriously. Focus on quality brings big rewards in the mid-term.

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I recently put together an Instagram post sharing my favorite development projects of 2022 and it got me thinking - why did I choose custom code over an app for these projects? With hundreds of Shopify apps, there are a lot of options to extend the functionality of your online store.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

But sometimes an app doesn‚Äôt quite cut it. More and more often, merchants are looking for tailored solutions.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Here are some things I take into consideration when choosing to go the app or custom coding route:

### Customization

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Apps:Often limited to their existing functionality but may allow for some design customization.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Custom coding:A talented developer can code just about anything a merchant may want or need.

### Development Time

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Apps:With some apps, you could be up and running in a matter of minutes or with a few hours of setup at the most.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Custom coding:Depending on the complexity of the project, custom coding could take anywhere from a few days to even several months.

### Cost

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Apps:Apps are generally inexpensive (and sometimes even free!) but most have a monthly fee that you‚Äôll have to pay as long as you need that feature.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Custom coding:More expensive upfront but usually a one-time cost.

### Maintenance

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Apps:Most apps come with support from the app developers and are regularly updated to meet Shopify requirements.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Custom coding:A developer will need to be hired for any changes, updates, or fixes.

- Modifying Shopify Themes Workshop- I created a workshop that shows you how to modify a Shopify theme with CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and JSON.
- Iconoir- One of my go-to resources for open source icons these days. I like that icons are available in SVG format and no link is required to use for free.

## One app I like:

[Smile: Loyalty & Rewards](https://apps.shopify.com/smile-io?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-12-app-vs-custom-code)by Smile.io

Existing customers tend to buy more frequently and spend more than new customers. So why not reward them for their loyalty?

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

With Smile, customers can earn points by taking actions like placing an order, following social channels, and even celebrating a birthday. You can also use this app to reward referrals in a give $10, get $10 promotion, for example.

I‚Äôm guessing most of us would rather be creating or developing than dealing with admin tasks. One of my goals for the new year is to streamline my client processes and automate them so I can spend more time doing what I love.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

One of the things that has helped me the most in this area is having templates for almost everything! Having a template for client inquiries, discovery calls, proposals, contracts, client feedback and more has freed up so much of my time.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Before templates, I felt like I was re-inventing the wheel with every project. Now I know exactly what I need to do with each project and I‚Äôve freed up more time to work on billable tasks.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

There are various reasons a merchant may want to make some products available only to specific customers. For example, I‚Äôve seen several loyalty programs where only VIP members can access exclusive products.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

You could set this up with an app like Locksmith (I‚Äôll talk more about this option below) or go the custom route. There are always multiple solutions to a coding problem!

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

To set this up, only customers signed in and have a specific tag can access the ‚Äúlocked‚Äù collection or products. In this example, customers who are logged in and have the tag VIP will be shown a secret link so they can access the exclusive products.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

[Click to see example](https://www.thiscodeworks.com/show-secret-link-to-specific-customers/63555fed7ff59d00154c97a6?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-11-access-control)or see below.

{% assign vip_customer = false %}

{% if customer %}

{% for tag in customer.tags %}

{% if tag == 'VIP' %}

{% assign vip_customer = true %}

{% endif %}

{% endfor %}

{% endif %}

{% if vip_customer %}

<a href=""/pages/secret-link"">Secret Link</a>

{% endif %}

- Shopify Theme Customization with Liquid- This book by Ivan Djordjevic is perfect for those who need to brush up on their Liquid or Shopify skills. It covers a host of Shopify topics and has hands-on projects so you can showcase your theme customization expertise.
- Checkout Links- With a checkout link, you can select the products, quantities, and discounts you‚Äôd like to apply and send customers directly to checkout.

## One app I like:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

If you need more robust access control then Locksmith is the best app for the job. In addition to granting access if the customer has a certain tag, you can grant access by passcode, secret link, IP address or country, and so many other ways.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I‚Äôve used the secret link to give newsletter subscribers early access to a product and the country lock to hide products that can‚Äôt be shipped to certain countries. It can also be used as a solution for a simple wholesale program. I love that there are so many creative ways to use this app!

Spooky season is upon us and what‚Äôs scarier than a potential client who ghosts!? üëª You had a great discovery call, created a thoughtful proposal, and sent it over sharing your enthusiasm to potentially work together. And then? Crickets‚Ä¶

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

So you send a few polite follow-ups to see what‚Äôs going on. If you‚Äôre still getting the silent treatment it‚Äôs time to bring in ‚Äú[The Magic Email](https://themagicemail.com/?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-11-access-control).‚Äù Here it is:

‚ÄúSince I have not heard from you on this, I have to assume your priorities have changed.‚Äù

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

This email makes it clear that you‚Äôve moved on and removes the emotional reasons for the prospect to continue to avoid you.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Personally, I think the email sounds a bit robotic (just because your client is being a ghost doesn‚Äôt mean you need to be less human!) so I like to personalize it to match my voice and brand. If the client responds, great! If not you‚Äôve closed the loop and can move on to better prospects.

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

A basic principle of software development is the DRY (Don‚Äôt Repeat Yourself) principle. The goal of DRY is to avoid the repetition of information. This principle isn‚Äôt just for programming languages, we can use the same concept when working with Liquid!

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Let‚Äôs start with a simple example demonstrating the benefits of the DRY principle:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

[Click to see example](https://www.thiscodeworks.com/dry-code-example/6343587cc81859001594ec18?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-10-stay-dry-don-t-repeat-yourself) or see below.

{% comment %} non DRY code {% endcomment %}

{% assign star_rating = section.settings.star_rating %}

{% case star_rating %}

{% when 1 %}

{% render 'icon', icon: 'star' %}

{% when 2 %}

{% render 'icon', icon: 'star' %}

{% render 'icon', icon: 'star' %}

{% when 3 %}

{% render 'icon', icon: 'star' %}

{% render 'icon', icon: 'star' %}

{% render 'icon', icon: 'star' %}

{% when 4 %}

{% render 'icon', icon: 'star' %}

{% render 'icon', icon: 'star' %}

{% render 'icon', icon: 'star' %}

{% render 'icon', icon: 'star' %}

{% when 5 %}

{% render 'icon', icon: 'star' %}

{% render 'icon', icon: 'star' %}

{% render 'icon', icon: 'star' %}

{% render 'icon', icon: 'star' %}

{% render 'icon', icon: 'star' %}

{% endcase %}

{% comment %} DRY code {% endcomment %}

{% assign star_rating = section.settings.star_rating %}

{% for i in (1..star_rating) %}

{% render 'icon', icon: 'star' %}

{% endfor %}

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

In this example, we are using a loop to execute repeated code. This saves time and effort, is easier to maintain, and reduces the chances of bugs.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Whenever you finish writing some code, it doesn‚Äôt hurt to look back to see if there is any way you can DRY it up, including using descriptive variable names and taking repetitive bits of code and refactoring them into a loop.

We‚Äôve all been there - Working on weekends, answering emails at all hours of the day, and having an unscheduled call interrupt our work. The solution? Setting boundaries around how and when you communicate.

I like to be upfront with my policies before any work begins. I let my client know my business hours, how quickly I will reply, and how they can contact me.

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I've been thinking about improving my liquid writing habits a bit recently - which usually just means digging a bit further into liquid docs, stackoverflow and other resources to improve. Here are a few good habits (which you may already know).

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Wrap your conditional outputs

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Always wrap dynamic outputs in anif setting != blankstatement.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

eg.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Replace:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

This helps ensure that empty html or broken features don't get rendered on the front end.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Important Side note- using!= blankinstead of!= ''is preferred.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

blankalso checks for whitespace only strings, and undefined variables - not just an empty string.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

An example of how this works below:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Simplify your liquid when checking multiple 'equals' conditions

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

When you need to check more than a few values against another variable - you could write out a lengthy if statement with each condition to be checked...

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

eg.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Or you could write it much more simply using a comma separated string andcontainslike below...

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Break out of your loops after finding a match

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

If you're looping through an array to find one match, then be sure to break after that match is found so the loop doesn't continue running.

## 3 links you can‚Äôt miss:

- Shopify 2.0 Data Converter:Take your legacy settings-data.json file and pop it into the data converter. Out comes your new index.json data for the OS 2.0. (Shameless plug on this one - built by my partner and I.)
- Shopify Schema Builder:A neat tool to help you generate schema for new templates and sections. Built by a fellow StoretaskerRahul Tulsiyani
- CSS Grid Generator:Another builder tool - this one helps you visually create layouts with CSS Grid. Pretty handy, especially for visual learners/builders.

## One app I like:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

[Order Printer Pro](https://apps.shopify.com/order-printer-pro?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-8-liquid-best-practice)by FORSBERG+two ApS

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Order Printer Pro (OPP) is easily one of the most popular apps for generating invoices and other documents - I see it in almost all of my clients stores.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

It lets you create templates for invoices, packing slips and anything else most businesses need to print out.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

However, the reason I'm mentioning it is because it also generates dynamic links to all of these templates - the main use case for this is so merchants can add invoice links to their order confirmation emails.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

We can also decide to leverage the publicly accessible URL for these PDF's in automation workflows inside software like [Make/Integromat](https://www.make.com/?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-8-liquid-best-practice) and [Zapier](https://zapier.com/?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-8-liquid-best-practice).

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I recently set up a workflow inside Make that makes a call to dynamic OPP URL, downloads the PDF file, and sends it off to a connected printer (amongst other things). Pretty handy and a quick route for an MVP feature.

## One learning as a freelancer:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

You deserve some time off.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

The best and worst thing about being a freelancer is that you have freedom over your hours. A lot of the time this means you inadvertently overwork yourself to bring in more income - especially given its been a very busy year in eComm for us all.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

The flip-side of this freedom is that you need to actively acknowledge that balance is healthy, and you also deserve time off. What good is freedom over your time if you don't use it to live?

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

This is the last of my 4-edition stint. I learnt a bunch while researching for the various editions, and I hope you got some good takeaways too!

Hey all üëã!

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Welcome to ['i_only_speak_liquid' by Storetasker](https://ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com/?_gl=1*337bqj*_ga*MzQ4OTUyMDQ2LjE2NTM0NzIzOTc.*_ga_E6Y4WLQ2EC*MTY2MTE2MTMxMy42NS4xLjE2NjExNjM0NTUuNjAuMC4w), where active Shopify developers like me [(Erin)](https://resources.storetasker.com/blog/how-i-became-a-shopify-developer-erin-vaage?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-9-show-discount-on-variant-buttons) share learnings we face daily.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

PS: I'm an expert on [Storetasker](https://www.storetasker.com/become-an-expert?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-9-show-discount-on-variant-buttons) and work with the best wellness, beauty, and food and beverage brands.

Apply[here](https://www.storetasker.com/become-an-expert?apply=true&source=Anthony+Vita&utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-9-show-discount-on-variant-buttons)if you want in.

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

A common request I get is to show the discount percentage for variants. If you‚Äôre using variant buttons, it‚Äôs helpful to display the discount above the button. This lets customers know they‚Äôll receive a discount for purchasing the higher quantity without having to click on the button and see the updated pricing.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

This modification works for products that have one option (e.g. Packs) and multiple option values. For example, a merchant might sell a 4, 6, and 12-pack of soda. The 6-pack has a 10% discount and the 12-pack has a 15% discount.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Here‚Äôs how to accomplish this:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

First, we need to put the discounted variants on sale for a lower price. To show a sale price in your online store, your variant needs to include a sale price and the original price, called thecompare at price.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Next, you‚Äôll need to find the code for variant buttons in your theme. In Dawn, you can find this in main-product.liquid. Then you‚Äôll add the following code inside the variant label:

{% assign savings = false %}

{% assign option_variant = product.variants[forloop.index0] %}

{% if option_variant.price < option_variant.compare_at_price %}

{% assign savings = option_variant.compare_at_price | minus: option_variant.price | times: 100.0 | divided_by: option_variant.compare_at_price | money_without_currency | times: 100 | remove: '.0' | append: '% Off' %}

{% endif %}

{% if savings %}

<div class=""savings""></div>

{% endif %}

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

After this code has been implemented, style with custom CSS to achieve your desired look. Now you have variant buttons that show a discount!

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Bundles are a great way to boost sales and increase your AOV, but inventory management can be a pain. Many merchants resort to manually adjusting stock for each product in the bundle.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I have a better solution: [Bundles.app | Inventory Sync](https://apps.shopify.com/bundles?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-9-show-discount-on-variant-buttons). This app automatically syncs inventory for any bundled products that you create within your store.

## One learning as a freelancer:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I‚Äôm sure you hear it all the time - you have to choose a niche! For years I thought ‚ÄúShopify development‚Äù was enough of a focus.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Making Shopify my niche allowed me to understand the ins and outs of the platform and the people who use it. I became someone people want to work with and hire because I‚Äôm not a generic web developer. I uniquely understand my client‚Äôs problems and can offer the best solutions.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

But this year I started to wonder - how well do I really know my client‚Äôs industries? Of course, most of my clients were e-commerce, but the problems a fashion brand faces are vastly different than a food brand.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

So I decided to niche down even further! Now I work primarily with CPG brands and have an even better understanding of my client‚Äôs unique problems and needs. It also helps me stand out from the competition and become better known for what I do.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Shopify liquid and core web vitals don't play nicely at times. There are some quirks with specific liquid filters that can result in less performant sites... Even though they are in Dawn and recommended in liquid documentation.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I dug a bit deeper into using the stylesheet_tag filter with some (very unscientific) experiments.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Replace stylesheet_tag Filters

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

There's been a bit of talk about replacing[](https://shopify.dev/api/liquid/?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-7-should-you-stop-using-stylesheet_tag-speed)[stylesheet_tag](https://shopify.dev/api/liquid/?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-7-should-you-stop-using-stylesheet_tag-speed) filters with standard html link tags. The theory is that the liquid logic required to output the html tag slows down liquid render time.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Replace:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

with:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

The Test

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I decided to test this on a fresh install of Dawn 6.0.2. I populated it with some dummy product data (including product images) and ran Lighthouse (in-browser in Chrome) and Shopify Theme Inspector (also in Chrome) tests on collections/all.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I populated a fresh install of Dawn 6.0.2 with dummy product data - including images. I then used Lighthouse in Chrome Dev Tools to collect Core Web Vitals scores, and[](https://shopify.dev/themes/tools/theme-inspector?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-7-should-you-stop-using-stylesheet_tag-speed)[Shopify Theme Inspector for Chrome](https://shopify.dev/themes/tools/theme-inspector?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-7-should-you-stop-using-stylesheet_tag-speed) to collect 'time to render liquid'.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I updated relevant stylesheet tags in theme.liquid, main-collection-product-grid.liquid, and card-product.liquid from using the stylesheet_tag filter, to using a HTML link tag with asset_url.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Results

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I ran the Lighthouse reports 10 times and the Shopify Theme Inspector tests 5 times, and got the averages below.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Pretty clear improvements from changes to a few lines of code - and it only took a few minutes to do. YMMV of course - If I've missed something, please do reach out!

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

You could likely treat the use of the script_tag filter the same. I'm also very curious about other filters that have to perform complex logic regarding the data that is passed into it - like image_tag and media_tag - let us know if you've got any numbers on those...

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Most of the improvement will likely come from liquid logic in snippets that are rendered multiple times on a page (like grid items).

## 3 links you can‚Äôt miss:

- Shopify Liquid Inspector Tool:Used above - great for testing liquid render time. Always a good idea to try and keep it to less than 350ms.
- Atomic Design:Atomic design is a design system for thinking about how to construct components, pages and themes. Shopify used it for Dawn and is the reason for the repeatability of the design components in the theme. Honestly, it just makes great sense.
- Self Host Google Fonts:A handy tool to download font files for Google fonts. This means you can put them in your assets folder, and not have to make a separate call to the Google servers on page load.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Imagine Shopify Flow but more geared towards developers and far more powerful.

DataJet is perfect for automated tasks, import/export actions, and even connecting to external servers via FTP.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Like most great automation apps, you can listen for events/webhooks, and then have your custom logic performed. I've used it to pull inventory from PIM's and update the store, and to extend shipping logic at checkout beyond the realm of Shopify Scripts.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Mat - the creator is also incredibly helpful in getting you started.

## One learning as a freelancer:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Keep your pipeline chugging!

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

One of my first learnings as a freelancer came when I got incredibly busy and stopped generating leads. As soon as I made it through the crunch, I found myself with a lot more spare time.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

It took me a minute to realise that as part of my normal day-to-day, I was continuously lining up new work - and that new work takes time to turn into scheduled work. When I stopped lining up new work during the crunch period, I didn't feel the effects until weeks later when I had little lined up.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Lesson learned - always be filling the pipeline.

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I had a client recently ask me if their premium Shopify theme had lazy loading implemented as they couldn't see a lazysizes.js file. Great question - I knew it did, but it still triggered some further digging on my end.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

What is lazy loading?

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Lazy loading defers the loading of certain areas of the webpage, especially images below the fold, until they are needed. This can help speed up page load times.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

There's a couple of simple ways to implement lazy loading - using [native browser-level lazy loading](https://web.dev/browser-level-image-lazy-loading/?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-6-native-lazy-loading-vs-lazy-libraries), and/or using a js library like [lazysizes.js](https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-6-native-lazy-loading-vs-lazy-libraries)

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Native Browser Lazy Loading (AKA - HTML attributes)

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

You can now use the attribute loading=""lazy"" within your img element to defer loading of the resource. This is supported by most modern browsers.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Eg.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

<img src=""image.png"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""‚Ä¶"" width=""200"" height=""200"">

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

You can do this easily in [liquid](https://shopify.dev/api/liquid/filters?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-6-native-lazy-loading-vs-lazy-libraries#image_tag-html-attributes) using image_tag (which has replaced the deprecated img_tag)

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Eg.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

image_tag: class: 'custom-class', loading: 'lazy'

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Pros

- Liquid outputs the loading attribute, the img srcset, and alt tags for you
- Doesn't require js, so users that block js won't be affected
- Doesn't need an additional library

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Cons

- You have to ensure you don't use loading=""lazy"" on content that appears above the fold
- Might require a js library to polyfill older browsers anyway

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Lazy Loading Library

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

[lazysizes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lazysizes?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-6-native-lazy-loading-vs-lazy-libraries) is hugely popular and quite simple to implement. You add the file to your assets folder, and include it in theme.liquid. You then apply the lazyload class to your images. It can also calculate the sizes attribute responsively, using [data-sizes=""auto"" and an appropriate data-srcset.](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lazysizes?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-6-native-lazy-loading-vs-lazy-libraries#user-content-automatically-setting-the-sizes-attribute)

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

eg.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

<img data-sizes=""auto"" data-srcset=""responsive-image1.jpg 300w, responsive-image2.jpg 600w, responsive-image3.jpg 900w"" class=""lazyload"" />

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Pros

- Simple to set up and implement
- Relatively lightweight and can reduce the amount of liquid logic required to build the responsive <img> element.
- Calculates sizes automatically when using appropriate srcset.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Cons

- An additional library to add and load.

How to check your theme for lazysizes.js

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Sometimes theme developers include lazysizes or an alternate library as part of their vendor.js file. This was the reason my client couldn't spot an additional lazysizes.js file in network - so be sure to check thoroughly before implementing anything new!

[Accentuate Custom Fields](https://apps.shopify.com/accentuate?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-6-native-lazy-loading-vs-lazy-libraries)by Accentuate

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Even with the leaps and bounds Shopify has made with metafields recently, an app like Accentuate Custom Fields still has its use case.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

ACF gives you the power to extend metafield functionality with an amazing UI (for your clients), and features like repeatable fields.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I've used it to create custom product forms for a few different clients. The repeatable fields feature allows me to set up a UI for the client that helps them create each step in their custom product form - whether they need to put together different steps for customisable jewellery products, or for different steps in a customisable cake.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Accentuate gives the client a simple UI to create each unique step for each product - while storing all of the data in metafields. You can then loop through the metafields and render out your custom form in liquid and JS.

## One learning as a freelancer:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Track your hours, adjust your future estimates, and ensure you're billing for all of your time.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I still struggle with this - usually I err on the side of underquoting because I've failed to account for the unknowns. This usually crops up when I'm working on tasks that I haven't done before. As long as you're doing great work, there will always be tasks you haven't done before, so you always need to take this into account when quoting.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Once I started tracking my time more thoroughly, it became a lot easier for me to review hours billed as a whole - and then adjust padding or contingency in my quotes accordingly.

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Online Store 2.0 and JSON templates have been around for a little while now but... why don't more themes let merchants add custom product options / input fields to the Product Form?

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I've worked with a number of clients that were reliant on apps to add elements as simple as a Text Field to collect Names for Personalisation, or a Text area Field to collect Gift Messages.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Using JSON templates in Online Store 2.0, you can very simply build out additional Blocks inside the Product Information Section. This empowers merchants to set up templates with custom options as they need.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

It's pretty simple to add a new Block to main-product.liquid as part of the Product Form - right where all the other Case / When statements are.. Let's make the new block a Text Input.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

And then we add our schema:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

And now we have a Block for a Text Input field on the Product page. You can easily extend this functionality to Text Areas, Checkboxes, and other input types so Merchants can build basic functionality for their customisable products, without an app.

[Matrixify](https://apps.shopify.com/excel-export-import?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-5-custom-product-options-without-an-app)by ITissible

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

My favourite import/export tool for Shopify. This recommendation comes from my eComm Manager days and is something I still use and teach to clients that work with larger catalogues / complex product data.

- Export whatever you need in bulkAlmost any field for Products, Pages, Collections and more
- Manipulate all your data in gSheetsSo you can use all your VLOOKUPs and ensure your data is accurate and on point.
- Reimport itUpdate/merge with the existing data, create new data, or delete it.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Matrixify is super powerful and lets you control every aspect of the import/export process. It's 100x better than the native import/export functionality. No affiliation here, just a massive, massive fan.

## One learning as a freelancer:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Learn to tease the source of the problem out of your clients, rather than just actioning your clients solutions.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Clients often come to you with a solution they need actioned, without fully understanding the problem they're solving, or the range of tools available to them to solve the problem.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Your role as a freelance developer is part Product Owner too.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Teasing the problem out of your client, and then designing a solution and its requirements with your client is hugely important. It will often result in quicker development time with less revisions (and happier clients).

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

If you are a Shopify App developer, you are probably familiar with the wonders of the new App Embeds and App Blocks system. Theme App Extensions are apps that leverage the full potential of Shopify's theme customiser to implement customisable apps. It is effortless to build them, and we are finding more and more apps in the app store that use this new technology. In addition, the maintenance and development of these apps are less than traditional apps. They make a lot more sense for theme maintenance, since you do not interfere with the theme code.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

There are two types of applications in this category: [app embed](https://shopify.dev/apps/online-store/theme-app-extensions/extensions-framework?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-4-app-development-b2b-and-tech-context#app-embed-blocks) and [app blocks](https://shopify.dev/apps/online-store/theme-app-extensions/extensions-framework?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-4-app-development-b2b-and-tech-context#app-blocks). The first type does not have to represent a block within the web; it can simply be Javascript scripts, modal windows, or modifications of an existing block. App blocks are the closest to creating a custom block to be used within the Shopify Theme Customizer. However, app blocks are only able to use in Online Store 2.0. themes.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

An exciting feature of these apps is the new implementation of metafields under the ""app"" namespace, which allows you to use metafields exclusively within your Theme App Extensions. We can also use these metafields to make conditional blocks. For example, you can control the visibility of an app block, or app embed based on a condition in your metafield (a boolean).

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

The condition must be written in your application's scheme with available_if as follows:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

You can check more about this in the [Shopify docs](https://shopify.dev/apps/online-store/theme-app-extensions/extensions-framework?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-4-app-development-b2b-and-tech-context#conditional-app-blocks). Give these apps a chance because they are the present and future of the ecosystem.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Many store owners need a way to offer an online platform to sell their products to B2B customers, and what better way to do it than do it on Shopify. Shopify has announced a new Wholesale feature for their Plus customers, but it is still far away from what merchants need.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Wholesale Helper apps are the best to grow their wholesale business and simplify their operations without hesitation. It is the B2B app that I recommend and installs for all our clients. The best features for me are:

- Merchant can set up a B2B wholesale using the same storefront or create a separate wholesale experience.
- Offer wholesale pricing for each customer.
- Customise individual variant pricing, tiered discount, discount codes and more.
- Custom sign-up form
- Offer Flexible Payment Options Using Net Terms
- Fantastic support team ‚Äì They carry with the installation in the theme code.
- All of this works perfectly in drawer carts! ü§©

## One learning as a freelancer:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

A common misconception is that ‚Äútechnology‚Äù solves problems on its own. Instead, I see technology as only just a tool to solve problems, achieve goals and accomplish things. It‚Äôs not an end to a means in its own right.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Clients don't understand this about technology, and, commonly, they sometimes get carried away by fads or comments from a third party. As freelancers, we have to understand that we are the ones who leverage technology to solve problems, and we have to adapt it to each situation.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Therefore, context is the most important thing. We must be open to understanding each project separately and apply what best fits each case based on needs, budget, time and objectives.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Don‚Äôt just write code; offer an opinion ‚Äì Better for your client, and better for you.

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I can not start writing this issue without mentioning [Shopify Editions](https://www.shopify.com/editions/summer2022/dev?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-3-color-product-variants-and-shopify-editions). We are in the best moments of the Shopify ecosystem. And the marketing around it is phenomenal. To avoid boring talking about what you can read on Twitter or Shopify docs, let‚Äôs talk about code ;)

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I've recently had multiple chats with merchants about how to manage their product colour variants. Technically, 'colour' is a product variant. But because colour choice has such a big influence on a customer's purchase decision, it makes sense for each colour to represent a separate product. Here's why:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

1. Extended catalogue & SEO:You will quickly have a more extended catalogue on your collection pages which is better for showing off your products to customers + it‚Äôs better for SEO. (reminder that you can also choose to to render the variants of each product in your collection templates, but that increases your server rendering time).

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

2. Speed:By having each colour variant as its own product, you will have faster product pages. You can also improve your product JS to show a specific slideshow of images¬† depending on your colour variant, but my tests show that it decreases speed performance.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

It‚Äôs just much cleaner and easier to create different products for each colour variant of one item. But don't just trust me on it:¬†[Gym Shark](https://eu.gymshark.com/products/gymshark-whitney-high-rise-leggings-palm-green-ss22?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-3-color-product-variants-and-shopify-editions),¬†[Allbirds](https://www.allbirds.eu/products/mens-tree-flyers?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-3-color-product-variants-and-shopify-editions)¬†and the biggest brands agree!

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Once you have the different pages for each colour, you'll need a way to connect the product pages to each other. We've historically had various workarounds, but now with the new ‚Äúproduct list metafield‚Äù, it's much easier.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

First, let's create two new fixed metafields in the Shopify admin:

- One text metafield to specify the colour of the product
- One product list metafield so that the merchant can select all the different colours available for this product.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Now, the merchant will be able to see this in the product editor:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Next, all we have to do is add a new block or section inside the product template to display the list of different products (see the code better via this¬†[link](https://www.thiscodeworks.com/color-variant-selector-html-liquid-shopify/62bae4d0ec467b0015bec355?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-3-color-product-variants-and-shopify-editions#!)):

{%- if product.metafields.my_fields.product_list != blank -%}

<div class=""variant-list"">

{% for p in product.metafields.my_fields.product_list.value %}

<a href="""" data-color="""" class=""variant-img {% if product.handle == p.handle %}variant-active-hover variant-selected{% else %}variant-not-hover{% endif %}"">

<img src=""image_url: width: 150"" alt="""">

</a>

{% endfor %}

</div>

{%- endif -%}

code snippet for variant color selector
p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

After this code is implemented, add your custom CSS to have the look and feel you want - and that‚Äôs it! You will have a variant colour selector to move between different product pages!

## One app I like:

[ORBE](https://apps.shopify.com/orbe?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-3-color-product-variants-and-shopify-editions)by Mushdesk

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Shopify Editions was an excellent way to explain the advantages of [Shopify Markets](https://www.shopify.com/editions/summer2022?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-3-color-product-variants-and-shopify-editions#markets) to merchants. ORBE is an app that recommends users with a popup window to access the right international shopping experience based on their browser preferences and location.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

The advantages of the app in comparison to the Geolocation free app from Shopify are:

- It allows merchants to customise their popup geolocation window directly from their Theme Customiser.
- The application is SEO safe. We use the native Shopify form to move your customer to the right market without making unfriendly SEO automatic redirections.
- It syncs with your Shopify Markets, so the language selector will show the languages depending on the country selector that merchants set up on their markets setup.
- It works as other big brands likeZaraorBurberrydo with their international sites. Once it has the customer's consent to go to the local version of the site of one market, it will automatically redirect them to this version in the subsequent visits without bothering again. This guide the customer to have a better international user experience, and they always can change the country using the footer selector.

When speaking with new customers, it‚Äôs important to understand their expectations as quickly as possible. And even though I don‚Äôt like meetings so much, it's one of the fastest ways to uncover your customers expectations.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

In these meetings, I try to explain the estimated development costs so that the client has a ballpark figure in their head. If this does not fit their expectations or budget, I suggest finding other solutions.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I always find that building new quotes is one of the biggest bottlenecks in services.

Hey all,

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Welcome to ""i only speak liquid"", where active Shopify developers like me ([Roberto](https://twitter.com/robertoaresena?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-2-cart-drawer-and-line-item-properties)) share learnings we face daily.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

PS: I'm an expert on Storetasker and take on freelance projects from their client base. I've worked on [Cubitts](https://cubitts.com/?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-2-cart-drawer-and-line-item-properties) and other fantastic brands.

### What I‚Äôve been thinking about:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Line item properties are custom form fields that you can add to the product page, allowing customers to make choices or add information about a product. For example, if you offer product engraving, then you can use line item properties to let customers enter the text that they want engraved on the product. It allows merchants to collect custom information for each item added to the cart.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Last week, one client from Australia wanted their customers to attach an image to customize their item before adding it to the cart. In addition, they needed to change the user's instructions for each product they wish to enable this file upload input.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

We thought the best way to do this would be to create a custom metafield definition. In doing so, if the merchant added a metafield definition on a product, that input field with file upload instructions would show up on the front-end:

{%- if product.metafields.inputs.file_upload -%}

<div class=""i-only-speak-liquid""></div>

{%- endif -%}

code snippet for file upload line property
p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

We also needed to change the encoding of the form to allow files to be sent through a POST:

{% form 'product', product, enctype: 'multipart/form-data' %}

code snippet for product-form
p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

This worked well. But only when JavaScript was disabled. Unfortunately, this approach failed to add the file upload line property to the cart with the drawer cart enabled.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

We looked into the code and found that because the form submit data was serialised via AJAX, it did not send the file upload. The Dawn theme had the [same issue in a previous version](https://github.com/Shopify/dawn/pull/745?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-2-cart-drawer-and-line-item-properties).

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

To solve for that, we can use the [FormData object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData/Using_FormData_Objects?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-2-cart-drawer-and-line-item-properties#sending_files_using_a_formdata_object). But in order to use it with the jQuery AJAX call, you must set some additional properties:

var formData = new FormData(document.querySelector('[data-product-form]'));

jquery_default.a.ajax({

type: 'POST',

url: window.Shopify.routes.root + 'cart/add.js',

dataType: 'json',

data: formData,

processData: false, // tell jQuery not to process the data

contentType: false // tell jQuery not to set contentType

});

code snippet
p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

One of those cases which can make you waste hours, but you can fix them in less than 10 minutes!

## One app I like:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

[Plugin](https://apps.shopify.com/pluglin-app?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-2-cart-drawer-and-line-item-properties)by Blarlo

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I like the translation apps that use the [GraphQL Admin API](https://shopify.dev/api/examples/i18n-app-translations?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-2-cart-drawer-and-line-item-properties) from Shopify. Even though front-end translation apps like Weglot usually translate your content faster, I don‚Äôt think they are a good option for multilingual stores.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Instead I‚Äôve been recommending my clients to use translation apps like Transcy. But lately, we‚Äôve had performance issues or I found them to miss essential features such as ‚ÄúGlossary‚Äù.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I have now a better solution: [Plugin](https://apps.shopify.com/pluglin-app?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-2-cart-drawer-and-line-item-properties). It has a glossary feature, and I love that the team behind it is a well-known translation agency that has Shopify as a client: [Blarlo](https://www.blarlo.com/?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-2-cart-drawer-and-line-item-properties). This app enables you to translate your website with vetted human translators.

## One learning as a freelancer:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

When I need to send a proposal to a client, I always like to write everything using the same structure. In this way, I can always be aware that both of us (my client and I) have the exact same expectations. I‚Äôve been rewriting this structure many times, and Storetasker's recommendations have been a good inspiration.

- Context: A brief overview of what the client is looking to solve. For example: ‚ÄúI need to display one image on mobile and another on desktop for my main slideshow section.‚Äù
- Deliverables: What I will do to complete the task. For example: ‚ÄúCreate a new image input in the slideshow section to show a different image on mobile devices‚Äù.
- Process: Each step we will take in the development process to get the job done. For example, if it this the 1st task for a client, I will usually explain that we will create a Github repository to set up a development environment for their store.
- Additional notes: I explain that anything not described below will be out of this project's scope + I use it to add other essential information. For example: If you want to edit the metafields in bulk, you will need to add a paid app such as Matrixify.

## What I've been thinking of:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Internationalization isn‚Äôt always as simple as ‚Äúenabling‚Äù another market:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

Last week, I worked on improving the VAT experience for a European B2B business. They were displaying all of their products on their site, excluding the VAT tax. And when the customer arrived at the checkout, VAT was added to the products.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

But recent European VAT rules have enforced merchants toalwaysshow product pricesincludingVAT. The tricky part is that this VAT prices change depending on the European country the customer is in (20% for France, 19% for Germany, etc.).

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

To hack this, the client was using [Exemptify](https://apps.shopify.com/exemptify?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-1-shopify-markets). It‚Äôs a good app, but the issue is that the app was loading the prices via JavaScript in the storefront, not on the backend. So they were having price mismatching issues with Google Merchant Center and their feed.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

To actually solve this though, we can use the ‚Äòlocalization‚Äô object to show different prices Including VAT, depending where the customer is. Here‚Äôs the snippet of code I used on the product & cart pages:

```

{%- if localization.country.iso_code == 'FR' -%}

money

{%- elsif localization.country.iso_code == ‚ÄòDE‚Äô -%}

money

{%- endif -%}

```

code snippet using the localization object
p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

After that, we fixed the Google Merchant issue. Now the Google bot can read the same prices on the product page as the prices they receive via feed.

## 3 links you can't miss:

- Not only languages.This last month, Shopify has added to their GraphQL Admin API (unstable version and release candidate for June) the chance to custom content depending on the country, not only the language. For example, a ‚ÄúSweaters‚Äù menu title for a United States market and a ‚ÄúJumpers‚Äù menu title for a United Kingdom market. So powerful!
- Shopify Audiences. Shopify finally launched Shopify Audiences. A new exclusive audience building tool for US and Canada stores to connect Shopify merchants with high-intent buyers using machine learning. Shopify Devs explained it so well in thisTwitter threadhow it works.
- List metafields.Now you can create fixed metafields of a list of values and products. Not only powerful for a list of text values for collection filters, but also for quickly selecting a list of products. You can develop a product recommendations section on the product page that your clients can easily customise per product.

## One app I really like:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

[API HELPER](https://apps.shopify.com/api-helper?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-1-shopify-markets)by William Belk

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

This app provides a secure frontend API that provides access to essential functions from Klaviyo, Mailchimp, Omnisend and Shopify that are not accessible due to CORS policies inside Shopify themes. I‚Äôve used it to create newsletter forms on clients‚Äô themes or give custom codes to clients and not reload the page. It‚Äôs so easy to use if you know JS. Read more about it [here](https://github.com/belkapp/apihelper-for-shopify-docs?utm_source=ionlyspeakliquid.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=i-only-speak-liquid-1-shopify-markets).

## One freelance learning:

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

I‚Äôve learned to turn meetings into projects faster. Unstructured, impromptu meetings can often lead to bad advice, so I now turn those calls into projects faster. For example: A client may call me to ask about a problem that I haven‚Äôt faced. If I‚Äôm not cautious, I may divulge too much information and say the wrong thing or quote the wrong price.

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }

It‚Äôs hard to go back on your word once you said something on a call. So now, I increasingly say: ""Great, let's open a new project so we can review it and tell you the best proposal to solve it"".

p span[style*=""font-size""] { line-height: 1.6; }
