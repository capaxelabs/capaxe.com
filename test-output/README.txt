Email Template Testing
=====================

This directory contains sample email templates with inline styles (no Tailwind CSS).
Open the HTML files in a browser to verify that they render correctly.

The templates use inline styles instead of Tailwind CSS for better compatibility with email clients.

Files:
- sample-email.html: A sample email template with inline styles

To test in a real email client:
1. Open the HTML file in a browser
2. Select all (Ctrl+A or Cmd+A)
3. Copy (Ctrl+C or Cmd+C)
4. Paste into an email compose window in your email client
5. Send a test email to yourself

This will help verify that the email renders correctly in actual email clients.
